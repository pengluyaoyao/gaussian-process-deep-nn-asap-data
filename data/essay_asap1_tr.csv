The bad part is that if your on the computer all the time then you are neglecting time with family and friends . When you are spending all of you time on the computer you are becoming a couch potatoe and it is very unhealty of also a good reason is a family member moved and you had to communicate by webcam so if you like live in @ LOCATION2 and you have all you family here in @ STATE1 other by sending letter and by sending pictures but they can not see how you act and by phone you can only hear voices you can see anything .

Without computers it would be harder to neatly type assignments , print out pictures , and getting information . If we did not have technology as in computers I think a lot or things would go wrong .

For @ CAPS2 what I am doing right now is learning to type faster and faster . Another @ CAPS2 is some people are faster at typing than writing but some people write faster than type . Me personally am faster at than writing . My final reason is after a hard day at school or work you can come home , play some music and relax . It is a good idea to learn how to type fast so if you are let ' s say writing a story for school . You just started the story and it is due tomorrow . What are you going to do we will if you stared to type when you were younger by the time you are in the middle school you could type really fast . That way you could finish your story in time .

I believe that computers do not because you can not get exercise if you are always on the computers and @ CAPS2 ' s really hard to enjoy nature too . Another reason comuters do not benefit society is that you are not interacting with friends and family . hopfully I have encouraged you to not use computers as much and go have fun with your family . If you are always on the computer how are you going to get exercise ? @ CAPS2 ' s proven that more than half of united states of @ CAPS1 is over weight . Exercising is more important than using the computer and knowing that you could be doing something use that you know is better would not you do @ CAPS2 ? Interacting with poeple is important to do because you can meet new people and if you don ; t then you might learn to be shy and not make as much friends as you like @ CAPS2 ' s true taht oyu can make new friends over the computer but @ CAPS2 ' s not the some meeting them in person . Also if you do make a "" friends "" over the internet , you do not know if they are a stalker or a murderer .

The first reson I think they are a good effect is because you can do so much with them like if you live in mane and ur cuzin lives in califan you and him could have a we should chat . The second thing you could do is look up news any were in the world you could be stuck on a plane and it would be vary boring when you can take but ur computer and go on ur computer at work and start doing work . When you said it takes away from exirsis we will some people use the computer for that too to chart how fast they run or how meny miles they want and sometimes what they eat . The thrid reson is some peolpe jobs are on the computers or making computers for exmple when you made this artical you did not use a type writer you used a computer and printed it out if we did not have computers it would make ur @ CAPS1 a lot harder .

Computers have games for kids that help them learn , and , also , people learn new things , too . My first reason is that , computers allow people to stay in touch . If someone in their family live long distance then they could always use e - mails to talk . That way they will not lose each other . Also , sometimes , friends move away and you always want to keep in touch . Another thing is that , if they want to send photos to each other , they can use e - mail . Also , because , thru an mail takes forever . Please , let the people stay in touch ! My second reason is that , computers has games kids play . The games kids play could help them learn more . Sometimes watching t . v . do not help . If they acutually play the game and see what their doing , then they will got smarter . that is what we want for our kids , right ? Also , kids have fun playing these games . Do you really want to take the learning experience away ? My third reason is , computers help people learn new things .

The second reason why computers are a bad thing is because some people are doing innapropriate thing on them . If people are doing such innapropriate things on them why do not the makers of the computers block them ? I do not know , I mean what kind of sicko would put those sites up even ?

In my opinion I think you should know the compouter because it helps for school homework or projects , talking to family far away and finding new friends . My first reason why we should keep computers is because it @ MONTH1 help on school homework or projects . This is my top reason because it is really helpful and it is useful when you need it also if your computer it is not working you can go to your friends house and use computers , when your done you can save on hardrive and print it in your school ' s computers . My segond reason why you should keeps computer is talking to family . Without the computer you can not communicate with family . In my opinion computers are very helpful to cummnicate with family . If your phone is not working you can also use the computer to communicate with your family . My third reason is communicating and find new friends without the who are you going to meet and communicate with you can communicate with your family throught the computer , or even if your running late you can send them a message through the computer . In my opinion I think the computer it is a really good way to communicate with your family . I know that people say they spend to much time in the computers and its addicting , but its good for school work like projects and assignments , also people said its just to what on the but in my opinion we should keep computers because its no to see what is on the other person . Its to do school work and talk to family . I know people spend to much time in computers but to other people its not . In my opinion , we should not get rid off computers because it good for doing school work and talking with family .

8208,1387,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 we all know more and more people are using computers . Some believe that this would be a concern because it affects peoples health . I believe that with the advances in technology it would give us positive effects on people . Here are three reasons why , first would be that with advances in tech . It would teach us to be more intelligent . Second would be it it would give us the ability to have access to intresting things we can not get at the library like biographics and finally access to communicate online . My first reason @ CAPS2 I mentioned before was it would give us intelligence . If we have questions to something we do not know we could search on the computer and find our answer . We would learn this and would be able to teach others . The computer can give us alot of useful information that can benefit us in the future . My second reason is that advance in tech . would help us because it give us access to helpful website that teaches us . Not all information is found in the library the computer has access to biographics educational website and most important the access to educational advances for example online tutoring for students with difficulties in school . My third and final reason why advance in tech . would and could benefit us is that it gives us access to online communication . Some people will have e - mail for good reason for example teachers have e - mail for educational cause if a student is having problem in work , the student simply send the teacher a e - mail of the what the students difficulty is and what the student can do .

The reason why I think it is good is because you can contact someone that you know and talk to them whenever you want . Another reason is because you can play games or look for something or even make a research on stuff that you want to know or about something that you were always curious about . A computer is also usefull for better things like using it for when going to work or when a kid in school needs to do a report of project and needs to do it in typing and also to save stuff that you do not want nobody to use . Computers can sometimes be helpfull to people that really need it and that actually need to use it , but it can also be a fun activity to do if anybody does not have nothing to do . I think that the computer is awsome because anybody enough can open up their own website and create something what . A lot of people can go on the internet and open an account on a website ; for example a @ CAPS1 or a @ CAPS2 or a @ CAPS3 for that what to have an account .

8233,1310,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 , I am writing to you about how technology affects people . My argument is that some people think that Computers are taking to much of people time , I will tell you how technology keeps people from excersizeing and gaining life expieriences . Now I will explain in further details . My first reason for sayi - ng computers affect people is that they can not get excersize when there face is glued to a computer screen all day . And especially with the amount of kids palying video games or playing on the computer , the childhood obeasity rate will slowly rise due to them not getting excersize or they will just get very weak . That is why computers have a negative affect on people by not letting them get the excersize they need . My seconed reason for saying computers have a negative affect on people is that they will not be able to gain life experience I say this because when something asks you "" @ CAPS3 , what did you do today ? "" you are only answer could be "" @ CAPS4 , can we chande the question to what did I not do today ? "" @ CAPS5 when your on the computer all day you will not be able to explore and obseve nature we will maybe you could do that on a @ CAPS6 server but it is not the same .

A - lot of people are saying that computers have bad effects on people , like not getting enough exercise and spending time with your family . I do not agree with that because say you have family in a different town , city , or state . There is a website where you can webcam people from all over world with anybody , so that is a good opportunity and also it is free and you can do it at anytime and if you have a laptop , anywhere ! My next reason is that you get to see places you have never seen before with direct pictures , like on commercials when our familly wants to go on vaction to a far place and you know nothing about it . You can go on the computer and look up the place and see what it is about and also see what other people said about . Like if it is really hot , or cold , is it a good experience for kids , anything you want , the computer has it . My last reason on why computers are good is because of studying , one thing that always happens is I leave my textbook home . I can go on the computer and see what we had to do . Also you can use the computer to study and learn easier ways to do something for any subject .

Another reason is if you have family that does not live with you and you can not go an see them then you can chat with them .

I guess you guys wondering about what I mean about addicition to computers . we will I am going to give you three reason about this . My @ CAPS1 reason is people is not spending a lot of time with there family . I say this because most of the time couples get into arguments because the person that is addicted to the internet is not doing want he / her is suppose to do . For example say you have a turkey in the oven and your so in the computer you forget all about it until the fire alarm goes off . Another reason why people can be addicted to the computer is because all the online chat rooms they have . I know people that is addicted to online chat rooms and I sometimes get worried about them because half of the time they do not know who there talking to ! It could be anybody even a pedafile . My final reason is because some people just do not care . Some people can be on the computer all day and night doing nothing besides online chating when they can be doing a essay or something helpful or caring . You know I use to addicted to the computer myself and because of that I almost failed all my classes and because of that I do not use the computer to talk or anything such as that but now I just read my email or write my essay .

One of my fathers friends had everything on his computer . When a virus hit it all of his files were gone and along with his records . My father handwrites all of his papers . He says if i need to type something out I will buy a type writer . Also on things like facebook someone can see everything that another is doing . This is were alot of people pose as someone eles and thus @ CAPS2 people get kidnapped or killed . A very good reason is that when people have alot of personal information when a virus hitls that person knows everything about you that you put on . For exampel i was watching a show on discovery channel when a man hacked into a myspace acount and used that persons name to people and try to create a cyder to the pentagon , that person almost got caught but never was .

First of all computers help me and my fellow classmates with many asisgnmenrs . Some of us simply do not have the time to go to a library and look for a book that might nit even posses the information needed . On the internet you can find the same amount of valuable information or more ! It also helps to develop your hand - eye coordination some peopel say "" you can learn hand - eye coordiantion outside too ? Although that is true , typing is very fats and neat . As you can see my hand wriitng is not the best but I type very fast and make little mistakes so I do not need the neatest hand writing ever . The way I see it computers are the fastert way of doing alot of things . So if you spend time writign neatly you might nit even be able to go outside and see nature . my dad is a environmentalist and he uses computers . Sometime the easy way isn ; ' t always the best way that is why we must have balance . Do not infrom people to stop using computers but to balance thier time with them . Everything is good if it is balanced . for example , coffiene , In large amounts it is rather unhealthy but when you need a small you turn to caffiene and it helpd , same with computers . Besides , computers are now made everwhere , trying to get rid of them is simply unreasonable . We are already in a recession we do not need more trouble . I prefer to talk with my friends eye to eye however if you cannot do that a computer is a perfect alternative .

Another good thing is that you have the capibility to talk to people such as friends and family . To me that is very important and I am sure for you it is too . that is what I believe a few of the good things are . Now , I am going to talk about the bad things . I firmly believe that people are spending way too much time on the computer , without knowing how long has gone by ! You just stare at the screen , which is not good for your eyes . It can perminatly damage them . One last thing I would like to mention , is that when you are on the computer they tend to ignore their friends and family which could be a big problem . These were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people .",7.0,125,3.923490000875871,17.0,17,0.4310344827586207,5.0,1.5068965517241382,1.3792804872910605,0.006896551724137931,17.0

Not just for games . Computers help peopel do their job . For example , if you work as a lawyer , you @ MONTH1 need a computer to type your documents up . If you have bad pemanship and have a joblike a lawyer . You @ MONTH1 need to refer to something in your document and can not read it , that is a problem . So in that case , that ; s where the role of the comuter steps in . I also think that computers do not have effect on people because through garde schoo , sometimes kids need the internet . Some people do not have the option of a library of ther is not one near them . By using the computer for inofrmation on a project or homework , I think it benefits , not effects . I have one more reason why I think computers benefit , not effect . I believe that if you have a @ CAPS2 , or @ CAPS3 , you have a chance to meet people from all over the world . Just by that , you could learn something you could learn their lifestyle and things about thier culture .

Your brain will be fousing on the computers than school . You would be a bored kid or adult if you keep doing this . It will be sad if you throw your life away just because of a computers . The effect on people on the computer by not knowing technology is some people think that technology is dumb because you have a brain instead of a computers have information in your brain if you are smart . Some people are poor and never had a computer or never heard technology and country some of them do not even have technology or electrion because they can not afford for a computers . The effect that they do not know technology is they can find location and no cellphone you can call your friend go online and listen to music , play games chat to friend and family . Play games with each other . And watch movies . Another effect is learning about computers and how to use it step one turn it on . Click on intert explorer and search on a website to go on it is kind of hard to use the keyboard and typing it fast . The last effect is talking to people that you do not know form online .

Also people are getting information off of the computer which is a good thing for important paper that you might have to do or collage essay to get in to that collage . Another reason is that people are truning a bit lazy and not getting to enjoy exerising and getting to get some freish air . To more on I will explain what I mean about being with family and friends . For example let ' s say that your friends are planing on going to yhis huge beach party that every one is going to . So you tell your friends to pick you up but beofre they come you go on the computer talk to some you know and your friends come to your house to pick you up but you are not for them they pass on by you do not go go to school next day there talking about you miss the party .

You find a place you go on find good write come down yet of of the computer finish paper get grade that is good feel happy the end . So that is the only good end of the reason why computres are good . For some reason some people went to stay inside on the computer but other go outside on a good warm day . So what is your reason myspace , facebook other it is good if you talk to other people bad if all you worried about if your pics are good , what matters is there you need to be haapy .

We can chang people ' s lifes in third world countries with the help of computers . Computers can also help us in school . When a student has to write a report and he has bad handwriting he can just type it up and print it . Or if a student has to do research for an essay she can find the information easily on the computer . Maybe a kid forgot his homework , he can go to his school website and find it . My last point would be that computers are a huge help for buisnesses . When files are lost or misplaced , the worker ( s ) can use the computer and bring up the back - up file . When they need to order supplies , most times they will go to a web site and order online . Or when updates are posted about up coming events in that company , an e - mail is sent out and is found using a computer .

Some people who use computers use them for the wrong reasons . Some people search porn sites , and hack into servers . I believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things . Another reason why I am against computers is the people online are dangerous . A lot of people think they are talking to one person but it is really not that person . It could be anyone . Nowadays , people just give out information to random people . This is how kidnappings and murder happens in our world . @ CAPS3 - @ CAPS2 is also a major problem with computers . ( @ CAPS3 - @ CAPS2 ) - means @ CAPS2 someone over the computer . The effect of that is someone getting hurt on a crime not being solved . People also spend way too much time using computers . Instead of getting outside and enjoying nature , they waste time on computers . This is also the cause of a lot of obesity . People become obese due to not gettiing out and excercising .

8325,1574,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ ORGANIZATION2 , I have recently learned that the paper has decided to write about computers and how benefit society in @ LOCATION1 . I am writing this letter to say that I agree with how computers benefit society . @ CAPS2 first reason is that computers help people educate others . They allow people to learn about hand - eye coordination . @ CAPS2 final reason is computers allow you to talk online with your friends . There ' s a lot more in store so keep reading on . @ CAPS2 first reason why computers are good for society is computers help people learn about things . To start things off computers are a great way to help out in school because it is a quicker way to get an education . For example a computer helps you study for a test with information websites like @ ORGANIZATION1 . @ CAPS2 second reason why computers provide a good education is computers help you do your homework . For example when there ' s a major essay due the next day , you can go on a computer and type it . it is quicker and a lot more productive . I remember this one time when i had to write a final draft for an important essay and it was @ CAPS2 last day to do it . Since it was @ CAPS2 last day to do it the first thing I did was to the library and type it what would have took me an hour to write took me half an hour to type . That all hear I am moving on . @ CAPS2 next reason why computers help out in society is computers help learn about hand - eye coordination . Hand - eye coordination is something that must people have , but for those who do not the computers help out in many reasons . @ CAPS2 first reason is computers help learn yoga . Yoga is something to help take away stress inside of you . Computers have online video ' s that help you use it if you do not have the time to actually go . @ CAPS2 final reason is that computers help out with sports . Sports are something that everyone loves to participate in and something that everyone likes . Computers have videos that show you how to play sports and enjoy them as much as you do in real life . I am going on now . @ CAPS2 last reason why computers help out in society is you are able to talk with your friends online . @ CAPS2 first reason why you can talk with your friends is a website called @ CAPS2 - @ CAPS3 . Myspace is a website that is all about talking with your friends . It has grown extremely popular in chatting . @ CAPS2 final reason is online dating . If you want to start dating again you can always start online . It allows you to start a new life without leaving your room . I should probably start rapping things up . Now that you have heard all of @ CAPS2 reasons for why computers are helpful in society I should rap things up . Having computers in life is one of the most usefull things you can have . You can talk to your friends , learn handeye coordination and get an education . As you can see computers rule . There ' s so many more reasons but this is just one mans opinion who knows what other people think about them .",8.0,206,5.0643970698244525,14.702702702702705,37,0.3779816513761468,5.0,1.5614678899082568,1.520090708604365,0.012844036697247707,37.0

With all of these good reasons there should be an instant choice of it they are good or bad . But there is a main reason . it is areason that tells it is bad . Computers are for people . People had can not get off their write a hand written report or drive to the store to buy something . Not it . If computers never exiled , the world would no doubt be better all around place . There a lot of reason in which computers are bad . They hold information which can be hacked and by somebody thay you do not want to know something . Cyber bullying is a bad thing about computer . Another big is those stupid online games . People get addicted then they become lazy and eventually obese . So as I said before , part of society and should be .

Who has said that by using computers you do not interact with your family as much ? we will , I can tell you that I am staying in contact with my grandma , cousins , and aunts through my e - mail . With e - mail you can check up on news or simply write to friends and family ! Also , if you are planning a trip to visit your loving family members , do not bother with a map that gets in your face all the time and you just "" happen "" to get lost , try going on @ ORGANIZATION1 maps and plan the shortest route to your destination without getting lost along the way . Computers can do more than creating a simple map , it can give you precious information ! Many schools across the country use computers to help teach kids . The kids can look up @ LOCATION1 and in @ NUM1 seconds they have all the information they need ! In most school paper you have to type and provide what websites you used to achieve finishing the paper . What is also nice is that you do not need to go through huge books for one small piece of information . It is much easier , looking it up on the computer . Speaking of not using big books for imformation computers do not use paper and will lead us to a healthier tomorrow ! Millions of toms of paper land in landfills each day ! By using computers we could read online and conserve paper ! Another fantastic fact is that computers will grow in the future . people have already created touch - screen computers and computers will grow even more ! Many people think that using computers is a bad thing , but look at the facts ! does not the newspaper write the newspaper on computers ? If they did not , they would be having hand cramps all the time ! And what about docters do not they have your medical history on the computer , if not all these papers would get lost !

8329,823,1,"Some experts are concerned about people using computers and not enjoying nature and going outside . In my opinion people should use the computers but not a lot . it is @ CAPS1 to use the computer to chat with freinds , search some stuff you never seen . I say this because some people get addicted to computer games , or talking to your freinds the whole day . Next reason is to go outside , you can enjoy more stuff like sports , tag , and other activities . Instead of talking to a freind on the computer go to the park and talk or invite them over to you house . Another reason why I the exports are right about people and computers is to learn about nature and learn how to do things . I hope you have found my interduction good and reading on . My first reason is people getting addicted to computer games and other computer fetures . The reason I say this is because some people do get addicted on computer , it is @ CAPS1 to go on it some time ' s but not to much . It is better to go outside you got fresh air it is nice and cold . If you have a dog you should take for a walk or walk with your freinds . My next reason is going outside playing sports or running alround playing tag . Instead of using you could go to the park to play basketball or baseball . There are so many fun thing ' s you can do outside . You should go to your school and tryout for any sport that your good at . That way when you get bored there is always something to do , instead of being home all day . The last reason why I perfer nature over computers is learning on how to do something . it is better to learn stuff in real life than in computer ' s .

This is completly untrue and in many ways actually benerfits society . The internet is d fast d simple way to shorten the time spent doing activites we would already do . Instead of sending d letter to someone to invite them to the @ CAPS3 you could just email them . Letters can take weeks and can even get lost while email sends it to them instantly . Also what if the movie sells out or is canceld , do not worry with the internet you can reschedele and buy tickets online . So that does not happen again . Suddenly your phone rings , it is d call from your best friend saying to turn on the news , but you have to leave to pick up your kids in three minutes . Instead of waiting for the reports to stop talking and , you can check instantly on one of the many news websites and still be early .

One of the many ways is , they teach you hand eye coordination . So even @ CAPS1 your playing games your hand - eye coordination @ MONTH1 be improving . With hand - eye coordination you @ MONTH1 need it to play sports like baseball . When do you need hand - eye coordination the most ? I use it most , when I am playing hockey or , baseball . So next time your on a computer , remember your hand - eye coordination is improving . Another reason we benefit from having computers , is we learn about far away places . @ CAPS1 , you know about places that are far away from you that you can or can not travel to , use a computer to gain some background knowledge @ CAPS1 you travel somewhere on business and know nothing about it , what do you do ? I know ! get on a computer and do some research about it ! An example of this is , @ CAPS1 you have to fly out to @ LOCATION1 and do not know anythin about it , use a laptop on the way over there . @ CAPS1 you do that , you will have some schema about the place .

What will you do ? Download a free language learning app . @ CAPS1 you do not know a lot of french and need a few words but do not have a dictionary . Use a translator . When you are talking to someone from @ LOCATION1 and you do not know there language use an english to african dictionary translation app on your computer .

The only thing that kept me away from the grasp of boredom during the trip was my portable computer , that I played games and watched movies on . Critics of computers argue that people who use computers do not ever participate in physical activities . Of course , try exercising when you are crammed in a car traveling @ NUM2 @ CAPS2 , which is computers positively affect me .

8343,42,1,Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 : Computers have a negitive affect on people and their to connect with others because they always are on the computer and never outside . My first reason is that computers hurt your eyes after a long time sitting at them . People I know have complained of their eyes hurting after using the computer . Studys show taht @ PERCENT1 of all people who use the computer after a long time are more likly to loose their eye sight than people who are outside all day . Another one of my reasons is people who are inside on electronics all day are less likly to have good people skills . If you do not have good people skills then you probibly will not have alot of friends and if you need them it would probibly be over the computer . And you never know what they could be like . Also if your inside all day then you will not get the proper excersize could be very bad you and others . My third and final reason is that people will makes fun of you if you sit inside all day do not come out because your on the computer . If you ar on the computer you are more likly to fail in school you do not do your homework or projects but instead your on the computer playing games . And your more likly to get into fights with your parents or guardians because your on the computer and they never see you or hear from you . Also they will not be able to go online and pay their bills witch could be bad for everyone . So these are just some of the reasons I think computers could be bad .

Every where on the web are cool gamesor funny videos . On the web there are about @ NUM2 gaming sites and @ NUM3 sites with funny / weird / cool videos and pictures .

Say , someone wanted to take a trip to @ LOCATION1 they can look it up , learn the launage . They can by tickets . They could also find interesting things to see in that country . These reasons are why I think a computer is a positive technology . My next reason I think a computer is positive toward people is that people can comuicate online . This can help keep families in touch . It can help you find and talk to old friends ( facebook ) . You can even make new friends to talk to . These are other examples why I think computers are positive . My last reason I think computer have a positive affect on people is that it can help you with jobs . It can help you find a job .

8365,299,1,"Do you think computers have a negative effect on people ? we will I do not I think @ CAPS2 is on easier way to get information faster . The three reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people are to learn about faraway places , to have jobs in the computer , business , and you are able to talk to people from faraway . These are many other reasons but I ' @ CAPS1 only required to talk about three . First of all , you are able to learn about faraway places you can learn about places you are not able to see in real life . @ CAPS2 is a faster way to get information about news that would not be able to out on newspaper until the next day . If you do not have money to travel then you could just go on the internet and see the faraway places in many ways , @ CAPS2 ' s just a better source of information . My second reason is to have a job in the computer business . There are alot of jobs that require computers . If we did not have computers more and more people would not have jobs . Also , business would be slow because they would not have the information they needed . That is why computers are needed . Lastly , you are able to talk to people from faraway , yes people are able to talk through the phone but it is not the some if you get to talk and see the person . Video chat is a great way to make new friends and still talk with your old friends . You can talk to relatives , friends , or anyone you want to talk to . If we did not have computers you would lose touch with people you know that live faraway from you . That would be a terrible thing . In conclusion computers are an easier way to get information . You can learn about faraway places . You can have a job in the computer business .

All right like I said first we will talk about what the lack of exercise because of always being on the computer . Did you know that from being on the computer all the time you lose focus on exercising anymore ? Of you eating an @ CAPS1 not exercising , because your worried about the computer .

8369,1611,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , Computers are very important to some people . Everyone uses them or has used them before . It is not bad to own a computer because you can still excersise and be able to do the things you do everyday . Lets say that you need to look something up , the thing you always go to for information is a computer . People in schools , industries , and in homes use it all the time . Teenagers will usually go on the computer to talk to friends or maybe play games , I know I do . it is so they do not waste their time being bored all day . Excersising and being active is indeed very good for teenagers to really look into , but even though they do that , they do not push away the computer . It will always be there when they do not have anymore homework or when they finish running around the neighborhood with their friends . I can not imagine what my life would be like coming home from soccer practice and done with my homework and the computer or @ CAPS1 is one of the first places I run to so I can just sit back and relax . Computers should be known as our friends . They will not hurt us . They just give us what we need and want . Reaserch is a good example because everyone uses the computer to find whatever it is that people are looking for on it . And if they are done with reaserching they can have a little fun by games and friends . But I believe that the main purpose for computers is information . Whenever I get home from school , I finish my homework and stretch a little for cheerleading then whatch @ CAPS1 or go on the computer so I am not bored . it is not that I am not active because I am not working out or excersising . it is because I have nothing to do , so why not make my time occupied ? Everyone does it so I am not the only one . Yes , computers are just this square box with a keyboard , but if you do not push it away from peoples common lives than you can see that they are not what you say they are and they will not rot peoples brain or anything . The reason they are in an office or living room or bedroom is because people like them and uses them for their needs .",8.0,184,4.254774535180773,18.40909090909091,22,0.4532019704433498,5.0,1.4901477832512315,1.4226754683112182,0.007389162561576354,22.0

Also , spending to much time on the computers and others things then taking time exercising , enjoying nature , and interacting with family and friends . People who stay to close to there technology will be addicted to it and they will start to kill brain cells . Some times people get locked because to much information was given out or you did somthing that you were not suppose to do . Downloading certain things also bring harm to your computer like viruses that can crash downthe computer hard drive and system . There are many good and bad thing about being on a computer like the bad things stalkers , hackers , seizers , blindness . Then the good thing about being on a computer is it teaches hand - eye coordination , give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people , even allow people to talk online with other like friends or family . In my life it helps a little because I play lots of army games so when I go out with my cousins and friends we go label tagging in a sports complex and I use the same tactics that i learn to beat the other teams . It hurts some people eye site when all their doing is stairring durectly at eh screen . one experience was like @ NUM1 months ago the last time I stayed at my aunts house all my cousins do was stay on th ga me till they have to take a bath , clean and eat , They did not even go to sleep till eight in the @ TIME1 .

8371,831,1,"I belive having computers in a household is a good idea . They can play games , learn , talk and many more . Here are my three reasons having a computer is a good thing . Having a computer is great to play games ! There are so many varieties to choose from . There are card games , board games , even @ NUM1 games ! You can play solo , but it might be more fun and easyier to bring some friends along for the ride . As you can see having a computer can be fun , but it is not the only thing to do on a computer . Useing a computer to learn is wonderful too . The computer can take you to places you have never seen , heard , or been to before , or maybe a place you could not afford to go . You @ MONTH1 learn that in on place it is sunny all the time and in other places it is not . Another thing the computer can teach you is about animals . Animals have been here way be for us . There is still much we do not know about them . Many scientists have spent their lives studying animal and have put it on the iternet for you to better educate yourself . The computer can also teach you hand - eye . Hand - eye is great to have if your trying out for a sport like football , baseball , and basketball . Also you never know when you will need to catch somthing . My final reason is also very helpful . Being able to talk on the computer is good to using voice chat or instint messenger is your choice . While talking on the computer you might make some new friends that share the same intrests and hobbies you do . And you can chat with them as long as there online . Also while your talking you can express your ideas and feelings . Somtimes you might just need to blow off some steam . Or maybe post an idea that can one day be famous . As you can see games , learning and talking are easier to do on the computer .

8372,126,1,"Dear , @ ORGANIZATION1 concerned with an issue that people are using computers and not exersising . This is a very bad thing and we need to let the word out of what can happen if we do not exercise . The first reason why I disagree of the fact that computers help people is because computers really affect your health you will become fat you start having problems with your heart and it can lead to something fatal . Another reason why I think computers are healthy is because comptuers affect the economy alot in so many ways for example computers use up so much electricity it affects the power in all states . Computers also ruin jobs and this is very bad for the economy people will be addictied to computers for so long they will not bother looking for jobs they will just stay on the computer and gamble or buy stuff . The last reason why I think computers are bad is because of some of the illegal stuff people do on computers there are alot of cyber predetors that prey on kids and they end up finding the kid and kidnapp them . There are also other illegal stuff like bad websites or popups that can get you arrested so if kids go on computers they will not no what something means and they will click on it and it can traumitize a kid their whole life .

8373,802,1,"Dear local newspaper , The question that everyone is asking is do computers benefit to society . I used to think they did not benefit to society but now I think they do . I think this because , one good place to get information , two we live in a technological advanced society , and three you can keep in touch with people that are at the other side of the world . so do computers really benefit to our society ? Computers are a valuable resorce for me when I need to get information . For example , in my recent project in social studies class I need to go on the computer to get information on the subject . Also if you need facts on something and you can not go to the libary the computer has the same information . Also the computer is helpful when trying to find maps to a certain place or a phone number to a store . The computer is and always will be a great source of information . In the @ DATE1 technology is a huge part of society . For example the first computer that came out was this huge block that when you did something on it you would put in cardboard card . Now we havethin and small portable computers . So knowing how to use a computer is vital to keep up with the @ DATE1 . So are you going to let technology pass you by ? Computers are one of the best ways to keep in touch . For example if you call someone across the world your phone bill will sky rocket . But if you go on a website like facebook you can talk for free . Also another way to chat with people is by A . I . M . Another free way to talk to people .

Computer help people learn , give people a passtime , and all of that can be managed in a certain space of time so you still have time to go outside . Computers help everyone learn . It makes things easier by typing up essays because you could type it faster and it is eaiser to make changes . Also , it is cheaper to buy a computer and go on the internet and look up foreign countries then acually going there . Another example , is that a computer teachees you hand - eye coordination from typing and using the mouse . Finally , computers can teach you life lessons by reading articles another person wrote . Computers give bored people passtimes . One example , is that you can play computer games during rainy days or when you can not go outside . Also , you can talk to friends through facebook or aim . Another example , is that you can talk to distant family in another country by using programs such as skype . Finally , you can order stuff online instead of wasting gas and going to the store and the things you might order you can play with outside . A lot of people say computers keep kids inside do not know that their are ways to prevent this . One example is you can use shut - off timers that keep anyone from going onto the computer for to long . Also , many people learn how to manage their time on the computer . Another example , is that parents can make rules that their children are not allowed to play games on the computer on certain days and / or times . Finally , you can keep the computers in the family room so that children do not play with it all night in their room . Those are just some of the many reasons why computer help @ CAPS1 .

I had one of my best friends move across the country , all the way to @ LOCATION1 ! and I do not get to see her so I now video chat with her on my laptop . and if I did not have that opportunity then we probably would not have stayed in touch with each other . That experience was not only with a friend but it happened with a family member as we will , my grandmother . Every year for passover the whole family comes to house to celebrate but because she is getting older we video chat so she can see the whole family together . It is wonderful experience . As I said before computers can be benifical to @ CAPS5 . You might be thinking "" @ CAPS3 it can only understand that but I am a student at @ ORGANIZATION1 and sometimes I forget to write an assignment down so I get my laptop and go to @ ORGANIZATION1 notes . com , if that was have gotten a zero on the homework . See ! Computers are very benifical ! Have you ever been in a situation where you need something but you just do not have time ? we will now many things can be ordered offline . You can get things from food to cloths and toys . Surveys have proven that over @ PERCENT1 of average @ CAPS4 order off of the computer and save money from gas because they do not have to drive . Overall , I think computers can be handy and helpful to all ages , @ CAPS5 with homeworks , family and friends and adults who do not have a lot of time . And I think as years go by more and more people will start to realize that .",8.0,174,4.135163257296656,16.047619047619047,21,0.514792899408284,5.0,1.5946745562130178,1.6482387129958882,0.02958579881656805,21.0
8381,933,1,"Dear Newspaper , In think that computers are not good for the society . There are three reasons why I think this and these are the following ; @ CAPS1 , people do not get to spend time with their family . Second , you can get misspell words using instant messenger . When your doing your homework you can get distrated by the computer . The @ CAPS1 reason why computers are bad for the society is because people do not spend enough time with their family , I know I do not . I spend at least half my day staring at a screen when I could be outside walking my dog with friends . Furthermore , instant messenger is the most addicting . When I type something , I use abreveations for any word . The professor at @ LOCATION1 says at least @ PERCENT1 students spell abreveated words in tests . For example , if you wanted to spell "" what "" instead the @ PERCENT1 would spell "" @ CAPS2 "" . Finally , my last reason why I think computers are not good for society is because you can get distracted by it a lot . I know that because I am driven to the world of computers . When ever I do my homework . I can not keep my eyes off the screen . Therefore explains that computers are not good for society . In conclusion , computers keep you from spending time with your family , has students misspelling words , and distracting you from doing your homework . I hope you agree with me on this .",8.0,119,3.9440962403802855,14.0,17,0.497907949790795,6.0,1.5606694560669456,1.4466479595102757,0.02092050209205021,17.0
8382,1420,1,"Dear Newspaper @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 has come to my attention that there is a massive increase in people using computers in society . @ CAPS2 can have it is positive effect on people , but too much of @ CAPS2 is not a good thing . This is why I want to tell everyone about negative effects of the computer on people . We all know using computers helps people with all different kinds of things . They can help with business , interacting with family and friends , and you could even just use @ CAPS2 for entertainment . Some negative effects that some people do not know , or maybe just ignore , are things like they can keep you from exercising , exploring nature , and you could spend so much time on your computer , that you could get addicted . There should be some way of telling the people that this is happening and is a concern . So I think that we should try to combine what people like to do on computers , with what they should be doing more often , like exercising . Maybe we could tell people that they can use their computers to contact people like friends and family to go out and make plans to exercise and have fun outside so they are not stuck on the computer all day . We all know that computers can be a good and bad thing . They teach hand - eye coordination , give people the ability to learn about places and people in the world , and so much more . They also have bad effects , but that does not mean we should take them away from people . And you should not be outside all the time , for the whole day . So I think there should be a limit on how many hours people spend on the computers per day . This way , people get what they want , and they have some time off of @ CAPS2 , too . Obviously as a result there should be something done about this computer concern . I hope I have persuaded you with my we will - thought out thoughts and ideas . And hopefully they will lead you to an idea that will end in a helpful change in society .",8.0,157,4.0726055880928715,19.722222222222218,18,0.4410112359550562,5.0,1.5084269662921348,0.9640787648082292,0.005617977528089888,18.0

8384,842,1,"@ CAPS1 . The computer is a wonderful thing ! However the effects it has on people can be bad . Think of it this way , it has magnetic forces that pull people to it and keep them @ CAPS3 for hours . These magnetic forces keep people from exercising , stops them from spending time with family and friends and most importantly if they are not being careful they can get into some cyber danger . I spoke with the @ CAPS2 of @ PERSON2 and he said @ CAPS3 are so many people on their computers , people are not getting enough exercise ! "" @ CAPS4 people do not get enough exercise their bodies expand and become obese . This happens a lot to average people .

Even though you are talking to them you are not learning any new social skills . Typing on the computer is a lot different from talking in person .

8385,1342,1,"Do you think people spend to much time on the computer do . I think that kids and adults spend to much time @ CAPS1 , twitering , doing facebook and myspace . My resons include , people should go outside more , and play with real people , and spend time with family . Most kids should go out side more for example my friend @ PERSON3 spent @ NUM1 hours a day ! on his computer and haven went outside . Another example is my neghbor @ PERSON2 spent all day ! in his basement playing on his computer and haven went outside and since he hevet went outside he is terreibely the sun and he is now @ NUM2 years old an dhe still do not go outside it was because he spent to much time on the computer . Secondly , people should play with real people . For example there was a kid name @ CAPS2 and he allways played with vertual people an dfrends and never realy pleople and now he is so shy around real people that he will not even say one word . Another example is @ CAPS3 he only had vertual frend and never a real one and he is so depress becose he never had a best frend . Thirdly you should spend time with your family . there was a named @ CAPS4 and he never spent time with his family becse he was to busy writing emails and @ PERSON1 says that kids who do not interact with them will not have the same benifits as kids who do . Another example there was a family who were to bisy with the computer that the kids never met the grandparents and when the grand parents passed away the kids never met them becse they would rather play on there computers .

8386,1422,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 is your opinion on computers ? Are they good or bad ? Computers , have not been around that long but it is contrivertal wiether it has a positive or negative effect . True they do help people research certain topics but they are also hazardous . I believe computer are not a neccesity to people . Computers are uneeded because people spend way to much time on them , then we begin lack exercise , and they become hazardous to everyone . First , computers are not a neccesity because people send way to much time on them . Once you are on a computer for over an hour to an hour - and - a - half the computer will start to effect you in negative ways . For one your eyes will begin to hurt . If you stay on longer than that you will start to get a head - ach . Soon your head - ach wil turn so bad you can not bare it . It will pound and feel as if it is on fire . This happens because your brain cannot take in the brightness of the computer and @ CAPS2 your reading or seeing at the same time . Most of the time this happens eventually you will lock yourself in time a darkroom to rest . Sometimes you do not get off till they have a stomach - ach too . After they get off and feel better they go back on to repeat the process . This is why , computer are an obstruction to us . Next , people begin to lose exercise . After being on the computer for so long all they have time to do is eat , sleep , and go to work or school . Computer have deprived everyone of the outside . They do not want to go out and get exercise and play around . Living in those conditions can only lead to one thing , obysity . Soon you will become fat . Life will become tough . And being fat also has a negative effect . For one you cannot run very long , you become weak , and for kids you stop growing . But the worst is you will not live as long as you would if you were healthy . So you see computers are a nucence to our society . Finally , computers are hazardous to the envirnment . There are @ NUM1 billion people in the world . At anytime about @ NUM2 billion are on some sort of electronic device . When you are on a computer , have you ever noticed the hot air blowing out of the fan . Now , have you ever thought were this heat goes . we will , it makes holes in the ozon layer and causes global warning . The ozon layer is the only thing keeping the sun ' s ultra - violent rays from scorting us . Now if everytime some turns on a computer @ NUM3 of the ozon layer disapeared and @ NUM2 billion people are on that would be @ NUM2 billion mm gone from our atmosphere . Now think about global warming . If the ozon layer is like a bubble , the heat is trapped inside . So this heat will eventually heat up the earth . This will cause the @ CAPS3 to melt and then the sea will rise . The @ CAPS3 has enough water in it to flood the earth . Do you reall want that . Eventually we would drown and life would seece to exist . As you can see computer are a nucents . They hypnotize the young children and adults . They be helpful but more hazardous .

Third would be how to find out the news and weather , I if you did not watch the news because you missed it what could you do is go on a news site and watch the news that have been aired on tv , or a favirote show to if you want .

With a computer the knowledge of the world can be found by anyone . Lastly , the leading argument against is the people do not get enough exercise because they are always on the computer . The people computers say that people will because a thier computer that will the lives these arguments can be the overwhelming of heavy computer users do get enough exercise A recent status that among the internet average grade of A or better , who also do at least With this information the argument In conclusion , computers are not completly good or completly bad for society .

8390,1191,1,"Dear Newspaper @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 you think that children spend to much time on the computer . The issue that is going around is @ CAPS2 computers have good effects on people or bad ones . I strongly believe that they have bad effects on people . I believe this because people spend more time on the computer than they @ CAPS2 exerciseing . Another reason is that people argue it teaches hand eye coordination , we will so does sports and just playing . My last reason is that people argue that it is some thing that helps you learn about people and far away places , but books @ CAPS2 the same thing . I know alot of people feel that computer have good effects but the truth is they have bad ones . First , people spend more to on the computer than they @ CAPS2 exerciseing . People rather stay inside and play games on the internet then go outside and play tag or any sport . On a talk it was said that , "" In @ LOCATION1 people are alot over wieght "" , and it was also said that the number of over wieght people in the world was the of @ LOCATION2 "" . So I believe that people should get of the computer and exercise . Secondly , people think that it teaches hand eye coordination but so @ CAPS2 sports . Instead of being on the computer learning hand eye . You could be out side learning hand eye coordination . Again instead of just sitting at the computer your outside running around haveing fun while you learn hand eye coordination . My last reason is , that people argue that people use it to learn about far away places and people , but they have books for that too . People rather look stuff up on the computer but as soon as they are finsh the start playing games or the computer . Also some of the information might not even be true . Because people hack sights all the time and change things but you can not hack a book . The only thing you can @ CAPS2 to change it is to rip out pages and that only waste your money to a new book . So I believe that books are more reliable . Now is the time to make your disicion . @ CAPS2 computers have good or bad effects . I believe that computers have bad effect on people . Other things could teach you remarkable hand eye coordination and other great sources to about other place then the computer . Most importantly people should spend more time exerciseing the they @ CAPS2 on the computer .

8391,53,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , To begin , I understand that people do not like computers because they are over used . If the computers are so bad then they should not be used , but how I see it is that they also bring more good than bad . These points to computer wellfare are they bring sourses , their is interaction between people , and computers are going to advance more over time . Even though these people think they are overused they still use them . So , even I use the computer a lot , but it could be used for good . First and foremost , these computers can get sources online that can not be found in books . Their are search engines that you can find your topics on . Then , when you find your source it has info that could have been skipped over . They can show the other side of they story that they did not say in the book . your projects that you used to have to go to the library for you now can do from home , that itself is a step that you are not considering . For instance if people are on a lot @ PERCENT1 of the time is research . Furthermore , people can interact with friends over the computer . They can talk , send pictures , or play games . For example , i play xbox and I talk to my friends over that a lot of the time . Even a video game is fun as being with them , quoted from @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 "" I have a computer not for friends , but for work "" . This shows that even large important still use it for work . people say using a computer is like learning to ride a bike . My mom told me a story that she met my dad because he fixed her computer at her job . So , I am here with my parents because of a computer . None the less , the computers are at their begining and they will further improve . So people that are on have a reason for why they are on the computer . This advancement is going to advance again and again so there will not be a way to stop it thus , people will be on it only more and more so there is no chance of stopping the outbreak of computers . Then you will try to stop them with "" computers eat your brain "" . We all know that is garbage . To conclude , I implore you not to try and change the habits of others .

8392,1042,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , I took a poll of @ NUM1 people and @ PERCENT1 of them agree computers have a positive effect on people . Computers can help people talk to someone in a far away place , teach people hand - eye coordination , and give the ability to learn about people or places . Using computers is a great way to keep in touch with someone . For example , my grandparents live in @ LOCATION2 . Some of the ways I keep in touch with them are e - mailing , video chating , and instant messaging . Some other good things about talking to people online is if you are talking to many people at once or if your parents are on the phone . Another good thing about computers is they are good at teaching people hand - eye coordination . The ways of teaching this are typing , and clicking on something , @ CAPS1 people , when they type , look at the keyboard . But , with pratice , they will advance to looking at the computer screen while typing . To click on something , you need to move the mouse while still looking at the screen . That , believe it or not , is hand - eye coordination . One last reason computers are good at helping people is it a student needs to look up a place or person for a school report , they can very easily go to google . com and type in who or what they are looking for . Another option is , say someone is going on a vacition to @ LOCATION1 and they know nothing about it . They can go on the internet and get information on @ LOCATION1 with just a couple clicks of the mouse .

On a computer you can communicate with friends and family members that live in other states . Instead of sending letters to people by mail , now a days people use e - mails and instant message .

The adults use computers for there work ability and in schools .

As people get home from wherever , and they did not get the daily paper , the you can go online and look at it . For students , computers are so important to us because we get to talk to our friends and when we need to look up something , we just go to the internet . In some schools , they have really big books for different classes that they need to bring home . And that is bad for your back , so then schools came out with the books online . For those people who love sports , you can look up you favorite team and see if they won that weeks game . There is also vertual sport games that you can play for that is on the computer .

8425,399,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , I have heard that people are thinking of how computers are having a bad effect on people and I disagree . Computers help people so much in schools , work places , and at home . Not having computers would have a worse effect on people then with having computers . For students it is an absolute neccesity to do research , and type essays , letters and so many other writing pieces , and the same goes for all of society . In almost every school all over the country , students use computers on a daily basis . I personally have to log into the computer to type an essay for a class at least twice a week and some @ ORGANIZATION1 even more . For example my @ CAPS1 teacher asks our class to write a lot of essays or letters . She has told us over and over that if our hand writing is not good she will not grade it . Having the computers to type on removes the fact that if our teacher can not read it she can not grade it . I understand that people would say that it makes people need to hand write the things a lot less and people would lose the ability to hand write things but with such advenced technology on computers and to type anything with such pose , soon hand writing will no longer ne required . Any person for whatever research they need can be found so easily using a computer . For students in any grade level and any class , research projects are going to be assigned by a teacher . Using books and other means of research are slow and in efective . Getting onto a computer and looking up the pic is fast and simple and gives better results than books . The same goes for jobs , for example a person might need to set up a powerpoint presentation . Not only does the computer have powerpoint on it - which is an effective way of setting up projects the computer allows that person to do research all in one place . This makes it so much simplier to get a lot of information and not have to run around getting books and talking to people who know the subject . I understand that computers could "" take control "" of people and people would spend to much time on them . But of the few that do stay on computers to long learn to balance their time , keeping computers would benefit in so many ways .

8427,387,1,"Dear , editor @ CAPS1 you know , @ PERCENT1 of children who spend most of their time on the computer that do not exercize can develop weight problems and blood disorders ? That is just one way that advances in computer technology have affected people so far . If advances continue that number will increase and other problems @ MONTH1 arise from it . Some other problems that we have @ DATE1 that could get worse are , developing a weak immune system , and emotionally seperating yourself from your family . First , lets talk about obesity . Obesity is a terrible sight to see someone go through because of something as silly as being , basically , addicted to the computer . Not only can obesity constrict vital organs but it can lead to blood disorders . Blood disorders , such as high blood pressure and diabetes , can cause you to have a heart attack . Which cuts off oxygen to vital areas of the body . Which leads to , eventually , promote death . Dealing with obesity is bad enough , but seeing them suffer because they have developed a weak immune system is horrable . In my experience I find that people who are on the computer often generally do not have very good immune systems . For example , a friend of mine is on the computer quite often , and has developed a weak immune system . Because of it he misses at least @ NUM1 day of school a week . And because he misses so many days a school year he usually keep bad grades . Which is yet another reason why advances in computer technology are a bad idea . So is not it relatively obvious that advances in technology are a bad idea ?

8431,1262,1,"Dear local newspaper , Have you ever noticed how a lot of people are always on their laptop or their computer ? we will , when they are on the web they do not get exercise at all . I have three seasons why people should spend less time on their computers . People could get sick , probably forget a lot of stuff , and never have the future that they have always wanted . My first reason why people should spend less time on their computer is people could get sick . For example , their are a lot of people who just eat and eat and only use their computers . Some people get obese by doing this . When they do they go on the internet to find out how to lose weight , but they never do it . Some people go on the internet so they can have a surgery because they are so fat . They think their is a cure for obese on the internet , but the truth is that the only cure their is by doing . Some exercise because that is the only cure they will get if their not on their computer . When people are surfing the web they forget a lot of stuff . Some people almost spend their whole day or even life on their computer that they do not know what else to do , but surf the web . What I have seen happen is that some people forget where they are at or who the even are . They also forget who their family is and never contact each other at all . This is not good people . My third and final reason is no future . Sure some people apply for jobs at home from the computer , but the only problem their is that they do not get enough exercise and paid as we will as the people who work outside their house . Some people wanted to do something about their life ' s and how they can not because they are addicted to their computers . Some people have to go to thearapy so they can stop going on the internet .

People are not getting enough exercise , @ NUM2 . People get lazy and changes while being on the computer an mount of time , @ NUM3 . They will get addicted to the computer . The first reason is because people are not getting enough exercise I pick that reason because people I know gain a lot of weight and it is kinda of sad because they do nothing but stay on the computer and eat . Another detail is that the computer messes up your eyes by staring at that type of screen . One time I did that and @ CAPS1 eyes felt weird after getting on the computer . The third detail was that people gets very fragile and weak . I picked that detail because if you get up off the computer and exercise your bones will become weak . The second reason is because people will become lazy and changes for an example people will keep asking you to get stuff and do stuff for them and you would do it because you be a good friend . The second detail is that the person will change , the person will be lazy to go to fun events with you as a freind . The next thing you you will not have a freind anymore . The third detail is that it is like your bestfriend has replaced you for a computer that hurts if a person you know for a long time has replaced you for a computer that is something that will make you depressed and make you wanna commit suicide too me anyways . The third reason is because the person will get addicted to the computer for an example you want to celebrate a birthday and the person says "" first I got to beat this level . "" @ CAPS2 the person saying that the person is not going to get off the computer . Another detail is that his day will go pass fast and that is like waisting days of life and people who died will do anything to get their life and to waist is not good .

When you have a computer you can get influenced by other musicians to create music . And where does eating that music need to go ? Into a computer to add beats and different vocals . You can also watch @ CAPS1 on there ! Not exactly @ CAPS1 but whatever show you would like to see . Some people even create movies on special programs . that is not all though .

The computer can also be very dangerous in many ways . For example sites like myspace and twitter can be dangerous for teens because of rapest . Some random person colud just start talking to you and ask you to meet them some where which could be dangerous . The computer is also dangerous because you could have inappropriate pictures posted on websites of you and not even know @ CAPS1 !

First off if you are taking you want to learn about where you are going . Computers can help with that ! Also if you want to find good hotels you can use the computer for that . If you need transportation just log onto google and type in what you are looking for .

You can @ CAPS2 many things while talking to freinds on the internet , such as : find out school assignments , find out due dates , make dates and many more wonderfull things . Hand - eye coordination is very important . Computers can help with that . Drivers need very good hand - eye coordination ; if you do not have that then plan on a big insurece bill . If you do not have good hand eye coordination then you are going to have a hard time with a lot of stuff . So that is why computers are a good thing to have in our society .

8452,350,1,"Dear local newspaper , @ CAPS1 you imagine a world without computers ? we will I @ CAPS1 ' t because I think computers are great . First of all if you have a computer you @ CAPS1 meet new people . Second you @ CAPS1 do projects on them or homework if you need to . Lastly in a computer you @ CAPS1 basically find out anything you want to know . Read ahead and discover why I think computers are great . Who does not like meeting new people , because I do . If you wanted to get new friends or find anyone who go to your school and you might not now you @ CAPS1 look them up on your computer . Also if you had nobody to talk to one time you @ CAPS1 go on the computer and try to meet new people . I know I do that all the time . Lastly it does not hurt anymore to make friends or talk to people online . it is actually fun once you try it . So that is why I think one reason that computers are great is because of the people you meet . Second reason why computers are great is because if you have to print something or make a project a computer @ CAPS1 help . My science teacher always wants assignments printed and how @ CAPS1 I do that with out a computer . Also if one day you forgot your homwork or any assignments just ask a friend online of if you have a school website look on it . Therefore computers are great because all assignments look , better when they are printed . My last reason is because on a computer you @ CAPS1 pretty much look for anything . For example , say you wanted to find a place to go to and you did not have a adress or anything , you @ CAPS1 always check on the computer . Also if their is a problem or something with you house , car , bills , or anything you @ CAPS1 always see if you @ CAPS1 get any hekp on internet . Lastly if you wanted to buy anything and you could ' t find it any stare you @ CAPS1 just get it online . So basically like I said you @ CAPS1 do anything .

You can learn almost different people and their cultural background , or even talk to your friends and families that live in other cities , states , or maybe even countries . Yes , some people might say they cost too much , but that is really only a one ime price . Computers can be very helpful to students as we will as teachers . That reason is because students can get homework help on educating websites . On the other hand it helpful for teachers because they can put their students grades online and will not have kids bugging you about what is their average in a certain class . Yes , I know their are bad unappropriate websites , but their are a lot of ways to block them . For an example I had a @ CAPS2 in @ CAPS3 and I needed a lot of help , and my teacher told me about a website called studyisland and by going on that everyday boosted my grade up to a @ CAPS4 .

8458,644,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , I believe that computers can be a very good thing to implement in society . First of all , if people never used computers they would miss out on an immense opportunity to learn about the world around them . Also , with computers , people can communicate with people from across the world . If people use computers more often they will probably develop the skills to pursue job opportunities on a much wider market . Because of this computers can greatly help any community . Computers can give many chances for exploring education . People can pursue a large amount of information with a relatively small space as opposed to using a large area of books . People can find alsmot anything they want to know about on the internet relatively easily . If not for solely learning but for reference . If someone is making a project at a school . Computers can expand on many peoples opportunities for education . Secondly , the internet can be used as a widespread communication tool . Any document or piece of information can be transmitted from say , @ LOCATION2 to @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS2 . C in a matter of seconds . Simialarly if two people are seperated by a large distance , they can easily communicate since the invention of social networking , people that @ MONTH1 have lost touch can easily meet again and discuss things . With computers communication is becoming faster and faster . Finally , because of an over - expanding job market , use of computers is becoming a common requirement of many professions . Most jobs that pertain to engineering require use of different programs for modeling and drafting . Also now most governments are networked with files on computers . Also , most any job that has to do with any sort of business has a requirement for the person needed to be able to type quickly . Because many jobs require experience with computers they shouls be a part of any community . In conclusion experience with computers can benefit any one person and entire society all together .",8.0,178,4.319119688469487,14.772727272727273,22,0.5460122699386503,7.0,1.8282208588957056,1.4353713907745331,0.024539877300613498,22.0

8465,1572,1,"Dear to @ CAPS1 this @ MONTH1 concern , Computers do a whole lot now of days . You can play games , do homework , socialize but do not you think there are better things than that . Such as exercising , enjoying the beauty of nature , and most importantly interacting with family and friends . These are all the things that computers take away from people . Once you get onto a computer you never want to get off . If you look at it , it does not take much work and energy to use a computer . So if you eat and use the computer all day your not really burning any calories therefore you will gain weight . Computers make people feel lazy sometimes therefore they spend less time exercising . That is not good for your health at all . Exercising gives you energy and is good for you . Have you ever looked out the window and saw how beautiful nature is ? When your on the computer chit - chatting with people and playing online friends do you think about what your missing . Everytime I use the computer I wish I could be outside playing and enjoying nature . Trees , flowers , plants , grass and lots of other things are what make up the earth , but some people do not apreciate those things . So next time your on the computer think about that . While your on the computer wasting time there is another homeless child wandering maybe looking for their family . Would you like to be that child who does not have a family or any type of friends ? Lots of people think of their life without a family but it can happen anyday . So I believe instead of wasting time on the computer we should go and interact with family and friends . Even if it is just having a conversation do it , maybe it can show them that you really care . In conclusion , I think that computers are a waste of time . I understand how people say it is used to comunicate with people but back then they did not have computers and they communicated so we can to . Computes make you spend less time exercising , keeps you from enjoying nature and lastly interacting with family and friends .

Every day they are on the computer . Finaly , one big main problem is : they stop inter acting with family and friends . When mothers and fathers are oh it they do not pay attention to these young ones and they are always on it . When teenagers are on the computers they do not talk to these parents , they ignore there friends and the people that care about them most .

When people spend more time on their computers than talking to your freinds , then they will be low on socializing and , after awile will not know how to communicate with people . All they would have to do is set a time limit on their computer and only use it for work otherwise . Computers could also be used for good things .

There are electronics out for children that they can plug up to there computer and learn different stuff . And you can pay your bills on the computer .

8478,1025,1,"Dear local newspaper , I believe that computers have a positive effect on people . It teaches hand - eye coordination , give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people , and even allow people to talk online with other people . Computers are one of the best technology invention yet to come that benefits society . First off , computers teach hand - eye coordination . For instance if you are in a rush to type an amazing long essay you will not have the time to keep looking back at your paper , the keyboard and the screen . So you would need to know where these handy - dandy keys are . However , if would be a lot more trouble if you did not have any knowledge about computers are where the helpful keys are . Secondly , people would be able to learn about faraway places . If somebody wanted to take a nice , relaxing vacation / honeymoon with their beautiful wife they would need to know the weather forecast so they would know what clothes to bring , and how much money they need to bring to visit all the luscious , freshest restaurants , hottest stores in this enormous populated city . Without a doubt , I would love to take a vacation , but if it is going to cost a fortune I might have to re - consider this amazing trip . Lastly , you can talk online with other people . On blistering cold days and you can not go outside , or call them because you do not have phone you can myspace or facebook them as long as you want as long as you have a @ NUM1 and only email address that nobody else has . Now it is time to decide ! Do computers have a positive or negative effect on people . In my opinion computers are great for society and we should keep having them around because they teach hand - eye coordination , and give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people . Best of all , you will be able to talk to your friend and family online . This is certainly a great form of technology people should have .",8.0,178,3.799827277913346,20.294117647058822,17,0.5144508670520231,6.0,1.6618497109826589,1.4958242288403438,0.0028901734104046237,17.0
8480,186,1,"Dear , Newspaper I am writing to persuade to put article in the paper about how computers have bad benefits on people . Computers make you unhealthy , bullying takes place on the computer , and it effects how you do in school . First , computers have bad effects on people because it makes you unhealthy . I say this because most people do not get enough exercise . Then you get obese from not having enoughb exercise . Eventually you @ MONTH1 or @ MONTH1 not get diabetes from being obese , but most of the time you do . The next reason why lcomputer have bad effects is because kids get bullied on the internet . This is important because when kids get bullied the feel bad about themselves . Then they all get very depressed . This is called cyber bullying . One example is , is that a guy came to our school to talk about his son . his son had killed himself from being bullied on the internent and at school . That is why bullying is an important issue and computers have bad effects on people . My third and final reason why computer have bad effects on people is that kids do bad in school . they do bad in school because they spend so much time on the computer that they stop doing their homework and stop preparing for tests and quizzes . Also kids get distracted in school because all they think or care about is going home and going on the computer . Kids also do bad in school because they eventually think that school is a waste of time and drop out . It is a proven fact that @ PERCENT1 of kids that have dropped out of school was kids that were always on the computer and they said that school was a waste of time . that is how a computers have on effect on school . Now remember , computers have bad effects on people because it makes people unhealthy . People gets bullied , and it has on effect on your schoolwork . That is how computers have bad effects on people .",8.0,137,4.333599031787422,15.318181818181818,22,0.4053254437869823,6.0,1.5266272189349113,1.3221793455166668,0.014792899408284025,22.0
8481,329,1,"Dear town @ CAPS1 paper , I would have to pick being for computers . There are a couple reasons why I am for computers and they are being able to talk to friends online , being able to learn stuff , and you can also play video games . One reason that I would be for computers is so you can talk to freinds online . So if you have a facebook or myspace you can talk to your friends all day if you wanted to . What I mean is simply by typing in what you want to say to your friend they will receive those exacte words then they will reply . For example if you wanted to just say hi then your friend would look at his / hers messages then just reply . So being able to talk to friends online is one example why I for computers . Another reason that I would be all for computers is being able to learn things . So if you wanted to learn a language then you would go to google or something and try to find a fast easy site . What I mean is if you goto google a whole bunch of site ' s will come up , so what you want to do is find the fastest easyest site for you . So being abe to learn important things like a language is another reason I am for computers . The last reason for me picking computers is because you can play video games . What I mean is if you were borde and noone to talk to then you can get on your computer and play a mind numbing game or an educational game for class . For example in science class we played a game on the computer and it had to do with gravity and that was what we were learning about so it was an educatinola game . So that is the last reason why I am for computers . I am for computer because you can play games . So now you know why I am all for computers . I am for computers because you can talk to friends online , learn stuff and play video games .",8.0,132,4.056807104023053,19.722222222222218,18,0.3707865168539326,5.0,1.4522471910112358,0.9910760598382222,0.01404494382022472,18.0

Now they just sign into aim , facebook , or myspace . Then they can talk in time . But that is only the good things here are the bad . People spend less time outside they do not look at any of the butey anymore . We do not spend time with our friends any more . I can not even remember the last time I had a face to face convetation with soemone if I did not have to . People on the internet can do anything they want . You @ MONTH1 be saying that is a good thing . Right ? we will the answer is no ! People can hack into almost everything . People can cyber bully others with out any one ever knowing who the other person is . People can also be any one they want online .

When I found out enough information I would then be able to find the ten year old . Before people wern ' t able to do this . If people start to see what is heppening with our exsistence the more people would stop being stached @ NUM3 to their computers .

Please keep reading to hear more about why computers are good . First off , computers give us the ability to talk with people all over the world . A lot of my family lives in different @ CAPS1 , and that is how I talk to them is through the computer . If you move away from all your friends and family , would not you want to still keep intouch with them ? we will you could by chatting with them on the computer .

Or I get an answer to a question . Are you a parent that wants to know how their child is doing in school ? You could go to their school website and check their grades in each class they have . To wrap it all up , computers save us money everyday . If you needed to look up information for a project without a computer , you would have to drive all the way to the library and buy a book . But with a computer , you could get information easy in the convienience of your own home . In conclusion , you could see that computers benefit us in many ways . Thay give us the ability to talk to friends and family all around the world . They give us the oppirtunity to look up information quick and easy . Lastly , they save us money everyday .

8484,516,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 , I have recently heard about the debate on whether or not computers are used too often . Computers can be unhealthy , I think that generally they are helpful . They give us many oportunities that would not exist without them . I will describe more of what I mean in the following letter . First , I will explain one of the advantages of computers . Studying and school work . Computers can provide people with ways to research things . For students , it @ MONTH1 be something like research for a project of essay . For adults it could be information on starting a business . In both of those cases , computers were used to get information in a simpler way then perhaps visiting a library , I , personally , know of a website called @ LOCATION1 , where teachers can set up online tests for students . This would not be possible without computers . Computer online courses can even taken , where a student can be taugh through the internet , rather than in person . This can be an advantage to someone that can not always get to classes . I would also like to mention that computers provide a popular form of communication . E - mail and I @ CAPS3 . These methods of communication have become extreamly popular recently , and I myself use both . I think for some people it can be bad because it prevents them from interacting with the real world . But in general I think it is helpful . It also gives parents and teachers another way to communicate . These are just some of the many ways computers are helpful . Lastly , I ' d just like to talk about how computers can benefit adults specifically . I know that many people pay their bills online . This is becaus if you think about it , is not it a hassle to have to mail your bills every month ? Computers greatly reduce that hassle . They can also make it easier to buy things you need , look for jobs , and many other things . Without computers , things like looking for jobs would require a lot more work than they do with them . These , again , are only some of the hundreds , if not thousands of ways which computers are helpful . In conclusion , I think I had made my point very clear . Any thing in moderation is okay . People that argue that computers are unhealthy speak of those who use computers too much . Generally this is not the case . Usually computers can do much more good than bad , and can make a persons life much easier . They help very much with education , and even that alone I think should be enough to convince you that computers are helpful . But as I said , I hope I made my point clear , and I hope you agree with me .",8.0,217,4.934170092176988,13.352941176470587,34,0.476923076923077,6.0,1.6175824175824176,1.5078971865617066,0.017582417582417582,34.0
8485,988,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , I think computers are not good for people because they could spend that time exercising , hanging out with friends and family and reading . The first reason I do not think computers are good for people is because they could spend that time exercising instead of @ CAPS2 ' ing you could ride your bike or even walk the dog , exercising @ MONTH1 be hard work but , it is better then staring at your computer screen . Just because you eat we will dosen ' t mean your healthy . You need exercise to stay healthy too . So , run , ing , walk the dog , go to a gym instead of sitting at the computer . Another reason I think computers are not good for you is because in the time your on the computer you could be hanging out with your friends and family . Lets say your family is going to the beach , you stay home to play games on facebook . Your family comes back talks about all the fun they had , even tho you weren ' t there . You could have been apart of those memories . Now time to compare with your friends . it is movie night , all your friends are going . But , you stay home to webcam with your aunt . You stayed home both times just to be on the computer . You missed out on a lot . My final reason I think computers are bad is because , instead of computer time it should be reading time . Looking at a computer screen and reading is a lot different then reading a book . Reading books increases your vocabulary , you learn about different types of litature . Over all reading books makes you smarter . When your reading online you just read what people say , basically rumors . READ !

8492,177,1,"Dear @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS1 , I strongly believe that computers are a big benefit to society these days . There is so much to learn on a computer . And it is a lot more fun to learn of off a computer than a book . For intinst , let ' s say a student had to do a report , but he could not get his hands on any book at all . All the student would have to do is type in a few words on the internet and hundreds of websites pop about any topic he wants to learn . Another reason that a computer benefits society is ways to keep in contact with family and friends if they live to far away . Like me for instints , I live far from my friends . And the only I could talk to them outside of school was on a computer . We would be able to talk in a chat room or on a game . The same goes with Family .

Like one time I was searching ( @ CAPS1 . com ) on how to fix a playstation @ NUM1 controller . I found out how to do it and it worked . While you are on the computer you can interact with friends , find out about the weather , and find out if you have any homework . The computer also teaches you how to do different stuff .

For example , facebook , myspace , and twitter . Even though you are on the computer , you can still do this , you do not always have to call them . I remember a time when I called my aunt from my cell phone , and it wasted my minutes . Something simple as this could have been done over an email . So computers do have a good point to it . Do you know online you can exercise your brain ? You can do this by learning new information you have not learned before .

Some experts are thinking that it is too much time on the computer , but it can be very useful to others , by helping them gain knowledge . Computers can even help get online , tutoring , so you can exercise your brain there also . Do you know you can enjoy nature anytime ? About @ PERCENT2 of our world enjoys nature . do not you think it can wait until later ? Also some people do not like the different seasons and might want to stay in their homes . For example , when it snows . I think nature is good , but I do not think others want to be out as much . Also I know we are apart of nature , and nature is part of our society , but the seasons change and it is lots od bad weather . In conclusion , the computer has some good sources .

First i think it is good because it can help school work like to do a research and for other things that you might have to do for school . A secound reson on why computers are helpful is because it teaches hand - eye coordination . It also can have people talk to their family member from a other country through a web - cam . All their computers can be realy helpful they can also be bad for your health and family . I agree that it can give less time exercising , instead of being on the computer you can go to the park or walk your and many other things then just bring on the comuter all day . It can also distroy your interacting with family and and friend if you stay in the house all the time useing the computers and your family and friends want to spend some time with you and your just on the camper . @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 newspaper wher the reasons why i think computers can be a good thing and a bed thing . I mostly think that computers are a good thing because if we did not have computers we would not have most of the things we now have in the world if it was not for computers . that is why i think computers can be more helpful just depending on the way you use it and how much you use it .

8499,846,1,"Dear local newspaper , I have heard about this issue concerning people are on their computer to much . In my opinion , i think that people should not spend so much time on the computer for several reasons . There are the reasons to why I think that people should less time on the internet , and more outdoors . One reason to why I think that people should spend less time on the computer and more times outdoors is so that they can get more exercise . When you get exercise you can lose weight . You can also feel lighter and better about yourself , you will be more active . Another reason to why you should spend more time outdoors than on the computer is because if you do not you will get very very very lazy . If you do not get out and play or exercise , you will become tired . Also , you will become cranky and want do what your parents tell you to do because your mind will be so into your computer screen . My last but not least reason to why we should spend more time outdoors than indoors on the computer is because we can miss out on family fun that goes on . Since people are on the computer so much they miss out an parties and social events . They @ MONTH1 also miss out on family dinners and movie night . If you do not want to miss out on the fun , I suggest that you get cuclasses more and stop being a lazy couch potato . As you cansee , there are many reasons to why we should spend more time outdoors doing activities such as going on a bike side , going kout to eat , as even a nice stroll along the heart while walking the dog . I really hope that my opinions means something to you . And I also hope you agree with me .

They are concerned there is way too much computer time . One time my mom had just bought a new computer and I stayed up all night on the internet . When I woke up the morning I was so tired and I did not want to go to school . I think you should consider less computer time .

I think that computer is a waste of time and is an excuse for you to not spend time with you family as to go outside and enjoy nature . This is why computer time should be reduced and family time increased . Absolutley , computers is the type of things that can kill brain cells if you spend to much time on it . Teenagers are the main cause of this and when they get on the computer and get on myspace and facebook they will not be learning anything and just kill major brain cells . When they go to school to take the cmts they are going to fail because they will not know anything because of the computer . Also , This is a big problem for familys because they do not hang out with each other because their always on the computer . The excuse for parents is "" @ CAPS1 I am on the computer "" then they never go and the children get very upset . This leads to anger problems then they stop listening to you . All it is , is cause and effect . My friends on @ NUM1 has anger problems and does not listen to anyone all because her family never hung . Consequently , peope spend most of their time inside on the computer , you guessed right ! my sister is on the computer @ NUM2 and she never goes outside to enjoy the nature .

Have you ever needed to know something about a state or a place that brought up nig news & you needed to get it ? Were did you turn to ? I know not a book , but to the computer . Without it how were you going to get your info . I think computers are benefitial to our society because it can help you learn and it could tell you when or where to sign up for activities . People interact with others different countries , states , & or continents . Next , is how computer could benefit our society . Computers could help us learn by searching up research for a paper or even expanding our general knowledge . For instance today my class & I are going to the @ ORGANIZATION2 @ CAPS1 to look up info on seat belts on buses . Without computers my class & I could not have get it done without the computers . If we had books , it would not have been enough to give to us all & that would mean we would have to share . With sharing some kids @ MONTH1 have hogged the books for a long time not allowing the other kid to get the info needed to do the paper , which would lead to a civil dispute in the classroom those two . With computers we have enough for each kid in the class . And , computers could help with gaining more general knowledge quicker . With gaining more general knowledge you become smarter . Next , computer can help set up activities . Computers could help go sign up for activities like baseball , football , basketball , or a gym . With the help from the computers you do not waste time going to the gym signing up , while you could do it at home . Maybe there ' s a waiting list to enter . You would have known that if you signed up online . For instance my little brother plays baseball & my parents signed him up online . All they had to do was to take him to the place to sign up & show that . I live in the town of @ LOCATION1 , while others had to sihn up , register , & pay . All of that could have been done online like my parents did not with the understanding of why computers could be helpful to society by being able to gain knowledge & able to sign up for activities .

They can lead to children seeing inapropriate sites , and maybe even a virus that crashes your computer ! Most of the programs to get rid of viruses block children and adults from seeing inapropriate sites ( like gambling , pornography , etc ) .

Some of those faults are it is bad for your eyes , do not spend as much time with family and excersising and the usage of going outside is less often used . Yeah , I get it that computers are very useful but they also kill your eyesight . If you have not notested more and more kids have been getting glasses and contacts , due to the use of staring at a screen @ CAPS2 day .

Using these computers is great for looking up your homeowrk , but if you stay on it for over an hour or @ NUM3 a day you will probibly become addicted to it and eventually you would loose your eyesight .

You find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users who use the computers . Some computers are bad education to some kids who are trying to learn majority of kids use computers for internet access most kids will be on the computer playing games that @ MONTH1 not be suitable for the age group . My first reason is when people get on the computer they find websites that others use . For example : @ CAPS2 , @ CAPS3 , @ ORGANIZATION1 , ect . Many people use websites to check the emails . For exmaple : @ ORGANIZATION2 , @ LOCATION1L , @ CAPS4 . mail , ect . My other reason to you why people use websites is for @ CAPS1 messaging . People sue @ CAPS1 messaging to connect with their friends , family , & other people they @ MONTH1 not know . People say it is a faster connection to people @ MONTH1 not could reach . For example : person does not have a phone , the person does not live close by & the person lives in another town . I also think it good research to browse people . For example you know someone but you can not find you can browse . Another second one is people maybe addicted . For example : they go on website & they go on it over & over & over again . they do not stop using it until it gone . In additional people think it keeps them busy . For example you do not have anything to do go on the computer . Lastly you find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users . For example , you find a website but it is not suitable for minor . Only @ CAPS5 adults could watch . One more thing computers are not bad education . For example you can learn from apropriate websites that builds brain muscles . My opinion is that I do think computers benift the society because it mainly helps you brain storm & you get to know websites & learn about them .",8.0,162,4.6111684014214696,12.75,28,0.452513966480447,6.0,1.6536312849162011,1.3787834934861758,0.03910614525139665,28.0
8542,1075,1,"Dear readers , I right to you today about the effects of computer usage . I feel that there are some positive and some negative effects from using the computer . You can talk to people , and you can get work done , but if you are at this to much you will be starting to gain bad health and miss other things in life . Throughout the computer , there is many ways to communicate with others , which is an amazing thing . Whether it be through a game , typing or real chatting , it is very important to talk to people and this makes things much easier than going out nad talking to people face to face . For , example penpals , over the years people have written letters to their penpals , but know you can send it over mail and email does not cost any money , just type up your letter click a button and done . Another positive point about computers is that you are able to get work done on it . From work for a business to school work , it does not matter . You bear of people using computers to do work all of the time . Why do you think there are computer labs at school or desks with computers in offices . Computers have become advanced and the easiest thing to get things done with . Presentations , essays , graphs , anything . A concern I have of the computer is that people are becoming to addicted to computers . Many younger people are overusing computers wich leads to bad health . When people sit in front of a computer screen all day only getting up to grab something to eat , people will because obese . To stall healthy people need to be outside and exercise . We need to make rules to keep people out in the open out to give the generation a healthy life . So , I have mixed feelings about computers . They can be amazing for a while but only for a while . And if you can not see this open your eyes .",8.0,170,4.138762693228388,16.6,20,0.5105105105105106,5.25,1.5675675675675675,1.2361602543738122,0.003003003003003003,20.0

Changed our way of life and have made things easier . I am a firm beliver that computer were one of the greatest invention of all time . Computers have had a very vital and positive impact on society . For example , education has vastly expanded since the computer . Both teachers and students have benefited . Students can now search the intrenet and learn about different places , things in history , how to read and write bette , etc . Also computers have been a major part in entertainment . From reading online news to watching movies and listening to music computers entertain all of us . And computers help us connect with friends and even meet new people . Aside from that computers make life easier . People can get degrees from learning online learn another . Research as also easier than is to computers you can just about anything than to computers . Some people say computers stop people acting with family but infact facebook you can still . Computer have also ourlives . From helping small buiness thrive by making it easier to make and recieve orders to help spread information globaly computers make this all possible . As I have shown computers have benefited society and have had a positive effect on human beings from educating individuals to staying in touch with relitives , computers have made their mark on improving the way we live .

8546,1009,1,"Has your daughter or son ever asked you that they want computer in their school ? Were you ever baffled when they said they were talkking about @ CAPS2 in the school , that they can teach hand eye coordination , gives them the ability to learn from far away places , or even allow them to talk to people all around the world ? What did you think about that ? Did you agree ? If you did then your thinking about the positive side and not the negative . Many reasons why I do not agree . Saftey , the money , health . Many people said that it is good to interact with other people but not all the time if your son or daughter interacts with people they @ CAPS1 know are you going to be worried . They can be asked who they are , were they live . Sometimes they even ask if they can meet up face to face . My friend @ PERSON2 said her school got those computers and her friend @ PERSON3 was asked to meet or with somebody she never knew and she ended up saying yes and @ PERSON2 says she nevered showed up . Would you ever want that to happen to your child ? we will this is only the begining . Once your child ' s school gets computers they will be addicted to @ CAPS2 , @ PERSON1 said that "" if a child does not go out and enjoy there childhood but they want concentrate on their homework , they will just eat and be on the computer eventually they will become obese . "" @ CAPS2 is very imperative that your child does go out and have fun and get exercise because then they will just be on the computers @ NUM1 . Have you ever wondered that ? Another thing is the school will have to pay alot of money , if your child ever damages the computers then you will also have to pay a lot of money too . Not only if your childs school gets computers @ CAPS2 will benefit you guys alot . I trolly and sincerly do not belive that students should get computers . Also your students computers @ MONTH1 get viruses because of inappropriate sites . Then your going to pay for that as we will . Lastly the school will not have enough money for materials . What will you do ? Your child is not there to be addicted to computers your child is there for education ! Do you still support these computers ! I hope not because there is a @ PERCENT1 chance that they will or will not get @ CAPS2 . Hopefully I gave you enough information about the saftey , money and health .

Some people @ MONTH1 disagree , and say that computers help children who are in school . That @ MONTH1 be true , but honestly only a couple decades ago the average student did not even own a computer , and school were teaching the same materials without the usage of them . Also , some children use computers to cheat on homework assignments and essays , and I am sure many people would agree that that is not helping education for schools . Another reason computers @ MONTH1 not benefit society is because of the dangers of them . Sexual predators sworm the internet , and many people talk to strangers over the internet that @ MONTH1 be harmful , without even realizing it .

8548,564,1,"The question is does computers have a positive effect on society ? Yes computers definetly have a positive effect on society . Computers teach hand - eye coordiantion , give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and allows people to talk to other people online . Computers put a positive effect of people . First , Computers teach people hand - eye coordination . I mean , computers help people learn how to use there eyes and hands t the same time . A survey conducted by @ PERSON3 shows that @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 people have better hand - eye coordiantion that use computers them that do not .

"" You @ MONTH1 be thinking that s computer would make you less coordianted BUT , computers really help hand - eye coordination in people . In conclusion the more you get to learn hot to use a computer the better hand - eye coordinated you will be . Second , computers allow people to be able to learn about far away places and people . i mean that a computer can help you learn about a faraway @ CAPS3 without paying a fortune in money to go the @ CAPS3 . I remember the time @ CAPS4 my mom and dad was going to go to @ CAPS1 to see a lot of the landmarks and my uncle came to my house with a brand new computer and my parents ended up staying home and saved themselves a large amount op money .

I know you @ MONTH1 be thinking that it would be a better experience to go to the @ CAPS3 but , it is really expensive to go to very faraway countries . In conclusion , computer can help you save money and help you learn . Third , computers lets people talk to other people online . i mean people go to special websites just to talk to friends . A survey done by @ ORGANIZATION1 . Shows that @ PERCENT1 of people talk to other people over those websites . aAmous social worker @ PERSON2 says "" @ CAPS4 people use these websites it helps them with their vocabulary and social abilities . "" I know you @ MONTH1 be thinking those websites are dangerous is at , viris software can prevent danger . In conclusion social abilities are up with computers .

8550,1086,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 post , I have been thinking about the way computers affect our lives . Oh this very topic , I am agreeing with the experts who say people are sending too much time on their computers and less time doing other things . I do believe everyone , including myself , spends a lot of time online . Even if it was research , do not you think it would be better to stick our head in a book to get the information ? The same thing apires to computer games , such as virtual kickball outside ? The main reasons I am trying to get are computers hold us back , they are not physically able to help us , and going away from the computer , or even going outside would be better . I had mentioned how computers hold us back , the more time we spend ; the more daylight we burn to do other things . I say this because instead of going outside . We want to stare at a screen and play games or chat with friends . Online chat especially has an effect on most people because were trading in a fun day for one where we just talk online and back internet . I also believe if we had a time limit on computers it is more a push to be social and go out and do things . Unforthetly , computers from that , and all we end up waiting to do is nothing . Another reason is that computers can not physically help us and make us active . I can to this one because I am a cheerleader , and I am constantly on youtube learning how to stretch and do new things . Even though I learn and spend time to watch how it is done I get hurt and can not do it . Which is why I try getting cut more to a gymnastics teacher who can physically help and interact with how I am doing . Lastly , I believe that the less time we spend would help us and be so much better . I know , after an hour or more online . I feel lazy and I do not want to do anything . However , if I go outside I feel full of energy and I am active . Being off the computer feels better and is better . To sum it all up , computers are great to have , but to much of them is not . It really does hold us back , and is worse for our health . Oh , and one last thing , too much time makes you less active . However , thank you for reading .",8.0,191,4.515366534981333,16.76,25,0.4547619047619048,5.0,1.4452380952380952,1.4093608652873644,0.0047619047619047615,25.0
8551,613,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 people are using technology . A lot of them feel that it is helping and improving their learning ability , others disagree . I personally feel that computers are an advantage but also disadvantage . I say it can be an advantage because it is giving people a chance to experience above and beyond what they are learning . I say it is a disadvantage because a lot of people are on the computer and they do not get a lot of exercise . There are pros and cons to computers but manly cons . How long do you stay on the computer ? @ CAPS2 people find computers more entertaing than going outside and getting some exercise . Since technology is advancing , more and more people are going out to buy computers . A lot of teenagers are spending more and more time on the computer , playing games and going on their favorite websites . That is one reason why children from the ages @ NUM1 and up are obese . They do not get enough exercise . That also leads into people spending time with your friends and family . I know alot of people like to spend time with their friends and family . But what if you were always on the computer and never made time to hang out with your friends or family . Your friends might ask you to go to the park with them , and you say no . Your friends are going to start pulling away from you . You might end up being lonely . Being on the computer constantly can ruins your life . If you are choosing the computer over other important thing , then I think we have a problem . Going on the computer all the time can became an addiction . I do not think people realize it , but it can . I can take over your life . I say this because when you have an addiction to anything , it is hard to stop . It is possible to stop all by yourself but that is rare . Majority of the times it is best to seek help , I personally think you should take all of these reasonings into consideration .",8.0,161,4.5883957858338045,13.423076923076925,26,0.46,5.0,1.6142857142857143,1.4034099330298797,0.017142857142857144,26.0
8552,533,1,"@ ORGANIZATION1 , @ CAPS1 computers are a part of our advanced technology . They have a positive effect on people because computers make almost everything easier , they can teach people things with tutorial or educational websites and @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 , and they keep people entertained in their spare time . Computers are becoming more and more advanced everyday and that is why I think people are so addicted to them , yet they do have positive affects . Computers make things a lot easier for a lot of people . If you really think about it , a lot of things that we use every day such as books , nice clothing , and music on the radio would not be here if it weren ' t for computers . We would have to hand write those books and hand sew our clothes . As for the music , we would just stomp our feet and clap our hands to make music . If ancient egyptians had computers , they would have built millions of @ CAPS4 . Our computers have programs like microsoft to help me do a major school assignment neatly . Computers have positive affects in this way . Everyday after I finish my homework and I go on the computer most adults think that all that us teenagers do on the computers are facebook and myspace . I do admit that I go on those websites , but if I notice that my grades are not in the best condition , I go on websites that can help me understand what I am not getting . Ninety percent of the time that I do that my grades go up and I get a satisfying grade . I have also taught little cousins of mine how to add and subtract using the computer in pre - school . Computers are helping schools teach students . Besides education , computers can also keep us entertained with games such as virtual solitaire . When I go on the computer , I might need to research something that I have interest in . Maybe I might want to know when @ LOCATION1 was invented or , if the universe ever stops . Maybe I do not want to watch @ CAPS5 all day to keep me entertained . Computers will save me from bordom . When I use a computer , I am not addicted . In fact it has a very positive effect of me . Yes , I might stay up countless hours , talking to my friends on facebook , but to me that is a part of being a kid . The next day I might learn something in school that I want to search deeper into . That is what the computer is for . Without computers we would not have some of the knowledge we have @ CAPS1 .

Also , kids need them for education reasons , for example , if you had a broken finger and couldent hold a pencil you would have to type . In addition , what if a student needed an answer to a question and there has no to help them they could go online and get the answer and learn . Theres many ways a computer run help a person . For example , they could need directions or some ones phone number or answers . Also , you can buy off line what if you live too far away from your favorite stare you can fast or der it off line . Also I believe kids should get off the computer any go out side and exercise , to day there is to many over weight people if people what for a walk instead of siting on the computer all day there woulden @ CAPS1 as many over weighted people .

Finnaly they do not spend enough time with family and friends . Now we have to determin weather people should spend a lot of time on the computers . Those people who spend alot of time on the computer could be going outside everyday to get exersize . Some parents got their kids hooked on playing on the computer all day instead of going out side to get exersize . They could ride bikes , scooters , play basket ball , wiffle ball . They can also go swimming play , sports , and go to a play ground . Finnally they could go for a long walk on the beach . People need to get fresh air instead of being on the computer all day . They can go sit on the beach for awile , go outside to watch their kids play or watch their games like baseball or basket ball , or they can go outside just to be outsides . They can go sit on their porch to wait for their kids to get off the bus from school . Those people who love to play on the computor do not spend enough time with their family or friends . They could go visit their family more often , go out for lunch with their frinds . Also they can spend more time doing things with their kids . Even though there is a chat on the computer it is nice to talk to your friends in person . The time has come to decide weather people spending a lot of time on the computer is a bad thing or not .

8556,568,1,"Computers they give you @ CAPS1 and reasearch from a for distance from you . But is it good for you ? Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people . I believe they @ MONTH1 be correct . I believe that a computer can be used by finding things out from far distances , it can also give hand - eye coordination , I also believe that it is ok to use a computer if you are just using it for reasearch or other needed actions . When useing a computer it gives you the advantages of researching and studying far away places . This is good because some people have intrest in places around the world . Also , @ CAPS2 need computers now adays , thier teachers give the write up typed assignments , or power point presentations . Also , parents you computers for work or maybe to get away from work to take a vacation they need took book it some how . Also , some say using a computer can give you Hand eye coordination . we will , it does in fact when you type . Some @ MONTH1 not know this hut typing is a skill , some people type fast some type slow and some are average typers . Also , to teach little kids maybe even some adults , people have created a typing game on the computer it will teach kids how to type . Also , some people who type super fast go to get test to see how fast they type the test gives numbers like seventy words a minute . People naturally type about thirty words a minute . I believe that people should be able to go on computers for needed actions such as research . Many kids have learned about these other websites such as facebook , I tunes , youtube , and twitter . Some become addictted so they never got off . Also , being on all of these websites and more try to give you things . that my give you a virus . Viruses can come in many strengths some can crash your computer some just send boat loads of pop - ups to your monitor . I feel that it is ok to go on the computer to do research or bok vacations . If you are addicted to other websites stop because you will crash you computer with one click of your mouse . Over all I believe computers are a great source to get information off of but should not be addicted so called toy . Computer have a positive effect on people . Just do not be addicted and got outside . and have exercise with friends and family too .",8.0,197,4.563470810263961,15.666666666666664,27,0.4646226415094339,6.0,1.6297169811320755,1.5677116575334584,0.021226415094339618,27.0
8557,981,1,Dear newspapper I do not think that computers benefit our society . I do not believe that computers can be dangerous they make people lazy and you can be easily scammed on the computer . One reason why I do not think that computers benefit society is because it is very dangerous . Computers are dangerous because people can get kidnapped or herrassed . The town of @ LOCATION1 police @ CAPS1 says that over @ PERCENT1 of kidnappings are from people that were met on social networks such as myspace and facebook . The police cheif also says that their are many cusses about people being herrassed by stalkers or people trying to harm them . Another reason why I do not think computers benifit us is because you can be scammed very easily on the computer . @ PERCENT2 of people say that they have lost large ammounts of money due to credit card scam ' s on the computer . On computers their are sites that will act as if they are selling you something and take your credit card number and all of the other information that you give them and they will take your card and buy thing with it and you will have to pay for it credit card companies say that most credit card scams and frauds happen over the computer . The final reason why I do not believe that computers benifit us is because they make people lazy . Computers make people lazy because they are packed with a bunch of fun things like video games and you can watch videos and you could shop and you could see just about anything on a computer . I did some research and found that @ PERCENT3 of people that are over weight have account ' s on multiple sites on computers . These are the reasons why I do not think computers benifit us . I hope you too heed to my advice .,8.0,141,3.581669303098558,22.214285714285715,14,0.4519230769230769,6.0,1.6025641025641026,1.0949143184120975,0.03205128205128205,14.0

These benefits have positive effects on people throughout the world and are why I support the advances in technology . Communication is a large benifit with computers . Whether you are keeping in touch with friends or organizing business meetings computer offer a large amount of aid . With the modern technology that is provided with the computer , people can instantly send messages to co - workers or friends in a matter of seconds . In some cases businesses completly relie on the computer to function ; for example , to have conversation with people accross the globe to discuss they are going to expand internationaly . Computers are greatly necessary for people to communicate and enable people to make plans with simply and effectively . The computer also supplies an endless source of entertainment . With the internet the computer provides the users with websites that enable them to talk to friends , watch videos , play games , and more . The computer provides a relaxing way to enjoy yourself when it is late at night or a rainy - day . The computer enables people to stay entertained , and relaxed when needed .

Now you @ MONTH1 be saying that is not true , that everyone has a computer , but the truth is they do not and they believe it puts negative attitude on people . People have many reasons for owning a computer and one is friends . Did you @ CAPS5 some people own computers because they want to stay in touch with friends from differnt states who live far away . For example , many people use @ CAPS1 or @ CAPS2 to connect with friends . I can make a connection because I have both a @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2 that I use to stay in contact with family friends from all over . Some people , like myself , even have friends from different countries ! I @ CAPS5 that many people want to learn about people from differnt countries and this is one way to do it right now I am learning some new things about the @ LOCATION1 because I am friends with someone who lives in @ LOCATION2 . While on this wonderful adventure of learning you @ MONTH1 even get yourself into a vacation adventure . A recent test was taking stating that @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 people like to travel but do not @ CAPS5 where . Some people say that people spend to much time on the computer but not enough enjoying nature . These people are wrong if one is on a computer and they are chating with someone from a differnt state or country then that person might persuade them to take a visit there . For example they would be able to go to the internet type in the place they want to visit and get photographs and information about the place . As a result , people would still get to enjoy nature . Sometimes using the computer could be educational . Many people @ MONTH1 disagree with that statement but it is true . For example when on the computer many people in their senior year of high school use it to take online college courses to get their degree because going to a regular college @ MONTH1 affect their work scheduale . This could also help students in any grade learn more about the topic they are studing . It would also help them on their reports . For example they would be able to get pictures and other information anytime they wanted to . As a result , the students grades would increase .

Computers have been known to help develop health issues .

Those who are glued to their computer screens are no better . It is stated by numerous of @ LOCATION2 ' s top doctors that too much time spent on the computer can cause damage to your health . Exercise is highly stressed by doctors around the globe and the only exercise a computer addict will be doing is typing up a storm . They can submerge themselves into obesity . This often causes depression as it begins to sink in . Addition itself is a serious health issue . I would not be surprised if they add a computer wing to rehab centers sometime in the near future . These problems are slowly spreading and we must come together to abolish them ! Family time is an treasured value , to the @ CAPS2 people , but lately , computers are ruining this tradition . With so @ CAPS1 people absorbed with online drama , friends , and even video games , family interaction is declining . People slowly remove themselves from reality and enter an alternate world of cyberspace . They @ MONTH1 only emerge from their rooms to use the bathroom and eat , scarcely resting . This can cause great tension or sorrow in @ CAPS1 families . Who can erase the horrifying stories of abduction from their memories ? Online predators are highly dangerous and extremely clever .

One reason is because people can learn about new things , it makes life a little easier then it is , and lastly , people can meet new people while they are on the computer . First off , we can benefit from computers because we can learn new things . People can find places that they have never heard of , or they can see what is going on in the world . Computers can help kids that are in school who want to learn new things . Computers help you find out important information that you might need to know in the future . Secondly , having computers in our society can make life a little easier for some people . On computers , you can order things from online websites instead of trying to go out and buy them . For people with no transportation , this ' ll help make their lives a little easier than it is . Or , for example , if a person wants to buy something that is not in stores yet , they can go online , and they might have it up there . Lastly , having computers can help you meet new people . If someone just moved from another town or state , this will help them meet new people . Or if a student does not know anybody from their new school , they might find them online and then they will be able to get to know each other . In conclusion , computers help our society in a lot of ways . They can help us learn new things , we all can meet new people . and computers can make our live s a little easier . that is whay I think we should keep computers in our society .",8.0,133,3.984109768385612,16.705882352941178,17,0.4666666666666667,6.0,1.4421052631578948,0.9366673818775626,0.003508771929824561,17.0
8564,931,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , I think computers have both good and bad effects on people . Some people just sit around all day playing games and being lazy . Other people actually use their computers for things that they need . Also some people need their computers for their jobs . I do agree that some people who spend all day in front of their computers are spending less time exercising ! Would you rather play games all day instead of spending some quality time with your family and friends ? Not me , I would much rather be with friends outside or having a family picnic at a park or lake . For other people though , the story is much different . Some people need computers and other advances in technology for their everyday life . A lot of jobs today require you to use a computer , for example working at a bank you use computers all day ! I also think students rely on computers to do work too . A lot of students type up reports and other things for school on their computers . Students also use computers to look up information . The internet can be a very good source for students . I know for me , the internet has come in handy for school projects , or maybe something as simple as just looking up a word . I can also see why people do not really care about advaces in technology or computers ! Some people do not need them for anything , and some are probably thinking people are on them way too much .

One of my reasons is that people that spend to much time on the computers they are litting their lifes pass by them . But the people that work on computers all day is a different thing . My second reason is that people could be on the computers and still interact with their family because they live with each other . My last reason is why do people want to be on computers all day . I am not talking about the people that work on computer . My last reason is that the people that is spending all their time on the computer they are letting their lifes pass by there . The reason I say this is because if you are on the computer @ NUM1 your life is passing by you . Because you are not doing nothing , just sitting in a chair in the computer getting fat . Also if you are going to be on the computer at least they to find a job on the computer . But I am not talking about the people that work in computer all day long , because they have to do it . it is their job to . that is one of my reasons . My second reason is that the people this me in the computer they still interact with their family . The reasons I say this is because you could be on the computer and will interact with my family because you live it the same huge as them , two when you are not in the computer you could be with your family and spend time with them . that is why i said that you still could interact with your family even you see on the computer . The last and final reason is do people to spend most of their lifes on the computer . The person I like this because type of person would spend most of their life on the computer and do not go find a job go enjoy their life . Also if you got kids you have fun with your children and make them believe that they parents that was to them , that , they had fun with them , and that they had somebody that they could look up too . So do not spend your life time on the computer geting fat , not spending time with their children and make something yourselfs . But I am not talking about the people that workon computers . I am talking about the people that do not work on computers . that is why I said do not let you are life pass by you . i hope you liked the prompt and that you will not spend a lot of your life in the computer doing nothing just getting fat and letting your life pass you .

I say this because lots of people can talk to family of friends long distance . Also the computer can teach you lots of thing . Finally it makes you more social . In @ CAPS1 strong opinion computers are better for the world . Firstly , many people can talk long distance with family of friends . You have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person . Also @ CAPS2 is another site where you can talk to friends and then you can have a lot and put pictures of yourself and even videos , even though you can talk on the phone and do all this but on the phone it costs money for a plan . When you use a computer it is completely free . Secondly , the computer teaches you things that help you later on in life , and it let ' s you know things as we will . The computer people made programs that can computers and more really cool . The programs teach you how to type , it is called type to learn or type for fun . Also they have programs that let you know how to read . It is great for kids because they need to know these things any ways . Finally , the computer makes you more social . This is because you have @ CAPS2 and it let ' s you know things that happen in school or out of school . You can talk to people on @ CAPS2 or email each other and have a conversation with them . You can also meet new people from other places and have a good relationship with them . You have friends with and know who they are and will not need to figure it out .

What I think people are focusing is what they thikn computers are doing to people , but are really not focusing on how it helps us in so many ways . One way that people say computers effects people is that we do not exercise instead were attached to our computers . I doubt computers do this not everyone likes or wants to exercise . And why would computers stop people from doing that . it is people choice , the computer does not forces them to stay in the house . And computers are a great way for you to catch up with friends and family . It could be online chatting and even sharing photos . And I highly doubt people stop seeing their fmailies because of computers it just does not make any sense . People who are against computer are giving people in chairs or controlling them , it is just silly . If people acually stopped to take the time and think ; theirs a chance that they would see how computers has helped us grow as a nation . And how much they used computers and that it really helped them than just searching through books for a ton of information . As years have gone by I could see that a ton of thinhs are runed by computers and that alot of people use them . And it has impacted our country , in my opinion a good way .

They help people in many ways depending on the what the person wants to set done . The ways that I use my computer is by staying in contact with my friends , a family , and it also helps me with my school work . I have been a live for @ NUM1 @ DATE1 and have already live in @ NUM2 different states : @ LOCATION3 , @ LOCATION1 , @ LOCATION2 , and now @ CAPS2 you would think I would have had lots of friends living in so many places . How do I stay in contact with them you @ MONTH1 use ? I use various and @ CAPS3 . If you get rid of computers I would not be able to stay in contact with tem anymore . Moving from place to place was very hard and sad thing to do for me . Another hard thing to do for me was moving away from my family , but thank to technology and computers I stay in contact with them . Imagine you have not seen you family in @ NUM3 @ DATE1 , we will sadly that is my life so many birthday @ CAPS4 all the family you can see is you parents .

One of my friends , @ PERSON1 , said this about the dell computers we use in the library @ CAPS4 ever u do not get something about what we learned in @ CAPS5 class that day . I use the computers to better understand it . Computers are a great way to research a topic , and that is why they should not be gotten rid of . I use computers every day for two reasons for school , researching or writing a project for any of my classes . Everyday I spend at least @ NUM4 our writing something up for school . Computers help lessen the time spend writing it because it is fast and easy it is easy to type something , like a @ CAPS6 paper on the ways to persuassive the readier . In the end computers are something we I need in are life because it makes life simpler . If I was to send a message to some of my friends in @ LOCATION2 through @ CAPS7 it would take seconds . Instead if I was to use the @ ORGANIZATION2 it would take days .

Ever since computers came out , obestity has gone up . all people do is chat to other people & think "" they do not have to know what I look like . "" They sit at the computer eating & eating . that is not healthy . I do not think computers are good also because they spend less time enjoying nature .

I firmly belive that computers have major effect on people , my three reasons are people do not have the exersise , they do not interact with others , kids are smocky they will sneak on if doing research for if was not . Online websites and games are like hipnotysing the people and making them stay on for hours . Most parents belive that having their child on a computer doing research for an hour is good ; however kids are and would sneak to pay online going or go to a website they were not allowed to go on and was not on before . Sometimes the best thing to @ CAPS1 is get some fresh air and interact with others . Buth with websites that make people stay conect for more than two hours they do not get fresh air and they do not interact with others .

People grow up fast when you think about it , and people start to eat , drink , sometimes sleep at the computer . People stay at the computer and eat their , they will not get enought exercise , they will start to get fat and soon an only stay at the computers because they did not exercise burn the fat off .

8582,467,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , Computers have many posative affects on society these days . I believe this because computers provide us with communication skills . They provide you with information and they increase your skill when it comes to technology . Read on to hear how i further explain my reasoning . First off , computers provide you with communication skills . I know that i am always finding the computer useful . It allows you access to websites that help you talk to new and dd friends . It is a fast and easy way to communicate with someone . Whether your at your house , or on the go with your laptop , you can talk to people all over the world . Secondly , computers supply you with information to write papers , newspaper articles , etc . When a teacher asks the class to with a paper about a specific topic , students can simply just go home on or type the topic in on a search . At that point they are automaticly supplied with thousands and thousands of different sources of information . I know that @ PERCENT1 of the population of the @ LOCATION1 , prefer computer sources over book sources because computers are so much easier when it comes to finding specific information . Lastly , computers increase your skills when it comes to technology . Although some computers @ MONTH1 be fairly easy to use companies are constantly trying to increase the difficulty of computers . They ar also always coming out with new software for your computer . By making computers and softwares more high tech , people the generation now is more technicly advanced than many other countries . As a whole computers have a huge impart on our countries technical skills . I believe computers have a posative affect on society . I think this because computers provide us with communication skills , they provide you with information , and they increase your skill whenit comes to technology . I hope i have made it so that we are looking at this from the same angle .",8.0,164,4.284241963111756,15.285714285714285,21,0.5093167701863354,7.0,1.763975155279503,1.1657840518150733,0.021739130434782608,21.0

But some experts believe they do not which is why I am writing this paper so that I can explain the positions from both sides .

Computers believe it they help us in life wether @ CAPS1 to keep information , talk online , find a good recipe or what ever it is @ CAPS1 there . That is why computers are so positive . It we did not have computers there would not be any technological advances that we have @ DATE1 , @ CAPS1 one of the most important devices . Let me share my expierence okay . I had a job interview right we will I could not find that street so I went on my computer and it gave me the directions I made it to my interview . that is why I think computers have posotive effects . Now the opposite side says people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising , enjoying nature , and interacting with fiends and family . we will I have some people spend to much time on their computer @ CAPS1 completely choice . And those are people who usually do not have alot of self control . And exercising who said that everyone need exercise in the persons already skinny what does need to exercise . For the interacting with friends and family you can do that I mean how long can a person look at a computer screen .

Cearly you can that people spending too much time on computer and less time exercising . I say because i rember a time when my you to spend most of his time on computers and not for school eitner he would story on for all most the whole day he would bring food up stairys and throw the plates on floor just keep eating and eating and go to sleep without doing any thing .

Also , I learned to type with type to learn @ CAPS3 . on my desktop computer at home . Many other people use it for these reasons too . They also might use it for typing a project or making a presentation . Others might only use it for chat and e - mail . These things can still benefit our society though . Using the computer for chat , such as , facebook , myspace , and twitter can also benefit our society today . These websites benefit us because we can meet new people , catch up with old friends , or even talk with carrent friends . also on @ ORGANIZATION2 , @ ORGANIZATION1 , or @ ORGANIZATION3 we can e - mail people instead of instant messaging them . For example , if you have something really big to say to someone you might want to write on email .

8587,1355,1,"I do not think computers benefit the society as much as every one thinks . When people spend most of their time on computers they do not have time to spend with their family , people do not excersise enough when they are on computers wich causes them to become obiese , and you @ MONTH1 meet up somewhere with a bad person you met in facebook or myspace . These are the main reasons computers do not benefit society . The number one reason computers ain ' t beneficial is because you need sometime to spend with your family . But , when you are on computers twenty - four - seven you have absolutly no time with your family and friends . I belive that families need to eat dinner together and have at least one hour with one another . Some good ways to spend time with your family is to play games together , go on a walk , or even go to a bike ride together . Did you know that computers have a medium sized effect on how people become obiese ? If you are at school from seven till - thirty and after school you spend seven hours on your computer you will become fatter because you will have absolutly no time to excersise . When you just eat and do not excersise your body will not just burn off all that fat you ate . When you are on a computer you are probably go on to facebook or myspace .

UGH ! I do not get this sometimes I am sitting at the kitchen table tring to do my history homework but I do not know the year the revalotionary war was . @ CAPS2 I go in my room turn the computer on and @ CAPS6 there I go to google and look up what I need to know .

Finally all my homework is done but my computer is still on I am going to see who is online that I can talk to and make sure I did not miss any homework .

8591,731,1,"Dear Readers , I believe that Computers do good in our country and have a positive affect too people . This is because it saves paper sending emails and you save money too , also you can learn new things about different countrys like @ LOCATION1 , and lastly you can iteract with people you know and talk to them and use technowlogy to your advantage . These are a few reasons why computers have positive affect on society and the wayore live . First off computers help save the environment and they do this by leting us not cut down trees and make paper out of them . Do you know how many trees are cut down a day around @ NUM1 trees and they are all not imeditly taken to the mills to be turned into paper . But thet stopin piles at loging sites and are leftrotting there not be my put to good work or what they should be . I feel that trees have feelings like us but can not talk with out a mouth . So when you cut down a tree it is like robing . Using computers we save trees and stop all that from happening . She one reason why think computers are a positive impact on love and society . Secondly learning you can learn a lot on a computer all you have to do is look for it . I learn many things each day at school because of the help of computers and I feel that is computers are use it can excellour learning and @ MONTH1 been a lot more in a lot shorter time then we would have my to find a book or the subject what you are looking for . Computers have made things a lot impact on children but we all new things I when we use computers . So computers are a good thing and a bad thing . Finaly you can talk and interact with friends . techknowlogy has advanced so much that we do not see the world in prospective like take a cell phone for example what do you see mostly likly a phone . But if you open it up what to do you find ? You will find a micro computer that is capable of surfing inter playing music just smaller size then before . computers revolutronized the way we look at the world and techknowlogy we can talk and play games usiing this techknowlogy most of what we see every day used with techknowlogy hike , a game station or even a car rardo . adn all of it is used to help using ract with one on toher . So I veiw techknowlygy a so good thing . In conclusion techknowlogy has a positive and negative impact by more positive than negative influence . Techknowlogy help us in our everyday lives and helps save the environment by letting us talk and save paper just by button . Techknowlogy has revolunoized the wat mankind lives and how they veiw society but it us all a good thing in the end .

I say this because all young children and teenagers want to do is get on to @ CAPS3 and @ CAPS4 all day instead of reaserching and things like that . I have three reason ' s why I think going on the computer for the wrong reasons instead of exercising , enjoying nature and interacting with family and friend is a @ CAPS5 first reason is because it is very dangerous and there are sometimes kidnappers on the chat room . @ CAPS5 second reason is because their taking time away from trying to learn stuff off the internet . @ CAPS5 final reason is because the interact influences violence . There are @ CAPS5 three reason , on to here more . @ CAPS5 reason number one why I say people are spending to much time on the internet is because it is dangerous . Young teenagers and children all enter a chat room online . Most of the time that is bad because kidnappers lie about their information so that you can meet up with them and then they take you away . So instead of being on the chat room you could be on the computer looking on the daily news or searching like that . This is why I say that the internet is not alway good to be on all the time if you are not or learning about the nation . @ CAPS5 second reason why I that speding too much time on the computer all the great sometimes is it is taking away from your come in the and go to the computer instead of doing their homework on reading . @ CAPS6 like computer sometimes more than they like is learned and that is not good because not knowing I could if they got up their is on the computer for educational games but they do not . reason why I am concerned that people using the computer a lot . @ CAPS5 final reason why I am concerned about people using the computer to much is because the internet on the computer can influence @ CAPS6 to be violent in @ CAPS5 ways all games and going on yo all the that affects the world if they keep seeing violence and things in that nature frequently . I say this because in this generation when they see violence it gives an image in more need and then @ MONTH1 think it is cool to do it because it @ CAPS6 like @ CAPS3 more than a book on the computer more than a look . When young teens see violence on the computer @ MONTH1 think it is cool . This is @ CAPS5 final reason why I was concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer . So these one some of the main reasons why I say that the computer is not always a good because people spend a much time on them .",8.0,164,4.0621985843163415,25.26315789473684,19,0.34095634095634103,5.0,1.490644490644491,0.8314743880097293,0.018711018711018712,19.0
8593,741,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , Technology such as computer is proven to have a positive effect on people . Computers teach you hand eye coordination , they give you the ability to learn about far away places , and allow you to communicate with others online . Technology is continuing to grow , and it is becoming to impact our lives more and more each day . One way that computers benifit society is that they teach you hand - eye coordination . For example , as a person becomes firmiliar with their computer they are soon able to type on the keyboard with out even looking down to see what letter or number they are touching with their fingers . Although the person is not developing hand - eye coordination @ CAPS2 playing a sport such as baseball , they have still developed this coordination . Computers also benifit our society because they give others the ability to learn about far away places . Instead of walking or driving to the library to find a book about @ LOCATION1 ; they can simply go online and type in @ LOCATION1 under a search engine . Within seconds , thousands of sources appear right before your eyes , and you did not even have to leave your chair ! That is another reason why computers benifit our society . Lastly , computers and technology benifit our society becaus ' they allow you to communicate with others , reconnect with old friend or family , or simply share the latest drama from your art class . I know when ever I am at my computer my instant messanger is always open . It is something I utilize everyday in order to communicate with my friends and distant realitive .

8594,678,1,"Dear local newspaper , I think people are spending to much time on the compture an these are my reasons , Less time exercising , an enjoying nature and interacting with friends an family . My reason is less time exercising people are to busy on the computer playing games an talking to other ones . do not you think you should be outside doing some exercising like running around or playing sports instead of being in your house on the comptuer doing nothing . People should at lest get @ NUM1 of exercising . You could be on the comptuer for a little while but not on it @ NUM2 . Take a break from the comptuer an go outside for a little bit injoy the weather an being outside . People just can not take @ NUM1 away from there comptuer time I find that really hard to belive that people can not . it is like the comptuer took over there brains an all they want to do is be on it an never get off . My second reason is enjoying the nature go outside for a little bit an see what is going on there go take a walk outside in the woods an look for the animals or look for animal tracks . There are a lot of fun things you can do outside like climb a tree or going fruit picking . You do not have to be inside all day an stare at the computer playing games an talking to friends . You could be outside injoying the nice weather you are getting . Peopl need to learn that there is better things to do with there time . My third reason is that interacting with friends an family . It inportant you spend time with them an see how they been an what they been up to . But instead people are always to busy to talk to there family members becuse they are always on the comptuer doing stuff they do not need to being doing . There are a lot more inportant things in life an people need to understand that . Family is way more inportant then being on the computer but people these days they put family second because they never want to talk to them or see them because they are always so busy waisting there time on the comptuer . Like checking there email is fine but waisting your time on these chat things like @ CAPS1 or @ CAPS2 or @ CAPS3 it is just a waist of your time people can hang out an do things they do not have to be on the computer asking there friends that they should just call them an ask . Dont get me wrong I have a @ CAPS2 to an it takes away from your hanging with family an things but I make time for I can hang out with friends an family an enjoy the natuer an I do exercis . So I dont see why it is so hard for people to do that . So in conclusion I think that people do waist there time on the comptuer to much like I said there are more inportants things in life an things you can be doing like exercising , Enjoying natuer an hanging with friends an family . So I hope you take my ideas an consider them an thank you for listening to what I think . I hope people can get it through there head that they dont have to be on the comptuer @ NUM4 .",8.0,191,4.421595983361066,23.66666666666667,24,0.33567662565905104,5.0,1.4710017574692442,1.0434356963218767,0.029876977152899824,24.0

8597,694,1,"Dear @ LOCATION1 , I believe that computers benefit society very much . I believe so fo various reasons that I will state through out this passage . Although sometimes people spend too much time on computer it does not mean computers are bad for society it just means people need to learn to spend their time wisely . Overall I think computers have a positive effect on society . One reason I am for computers is because they are a huge advancement in technology . They are able to make everyday life easier . They allow you to store information . Learn about many places , and communicate with friends and family . For one device to do all that is amazing ! Also if we can make something like computers imagine all the other possibilities of technology advancements . Computers are only the start of it all ! Anouther reason why I believe computers greatly benifit society is because they provide entertainment . You can watch movies on your computer , and download fun games . There is hardly anything you can not do on a computer . If it is cold outside or raining you can still entertain yourself with just a computer . Computers are very great to have around . Now anyone who thinks people spend too much time on their computer and that computers are bad for society is just wrong . I think those people are wrong because a computer can not force you to spend more time on it . it is your own fault if you choose to use your computer too much . You always have the choice to go outside and take a walk . Computers are only wrong if you choose to use them wrong , like the expression "" guns do not kill people , people do .

I believe kids should have the right to stay on the computer as long as they desire . Although , they should always make time go outside , hang out with friends , ect . The computer @ MONTH1 be fun but it is always important to get outside and enjoy nature . Another reason why students should not spend all their time on the computer is because of their health .

Although , I believe children should have the right on the computer , it is always important to spend time outside enjoying nature .

8600,306,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , Computers are important for growth . They teach us skills like hand - eye coordination , they allow you to talk online , and learn about faraway people and places . I do believe that it benefits society even though many people do not . Nine out of @ NUM1 schools use computers on a daily basis and their community is still fine . I know you think it is taking away real social time but it really is improving the community . Imagine a student playing basketball , and his teamate passes the ball to him and he can not catch it because he has no hand - eye coordination skills . That would not happen to him if he spent more time on the computer . There are many coordination games on the internet , like pinball of @ CAPS1 , that help build that up . When you play those games you keep your hand on the mouse or keyboard and your eyes on the screen . It helps you to not look down . When you play basketball , you can catch the ball and still throw it if you have good coordination . out of @ NUM1 people keep in touch with family or friends online . it is the greatest feeling when you talk to someone you have not seen in awhile because you know that they still remember you . When you talk to people online , you get to know them better and they tell you things that they do not want others to know . Also , when you meet up with them , you have more things to talk about . What would happen if you were to go to a location that you thought was nice , but it turned out to be the worst place ever ? It would be terrible , but if you looked it up on the internet , you would know the truth about it . Lets say you want to know about someone famous , you look it up on the computer . There are many educational things on the computer that can help you out in life . I do agree with you on one thing . Society is losing it is communication skills . Being on the computer all the time is not doning anyone good . Nobodys picking up the phone and calling their friends to talk . They are distancing themselves from everyone but their computer . We do not want out society to stay this way . The people who spend their day on the computer need to change . I think computers are an asset to the community . Many people believe that computers are ruining everything , but they really are not . Computers are good for learning about people and places .

8602,1719,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , @ CAPS1 about what the world would be like without computers . Scary thought ? I had the same reaction . A world without computers is a world of non - communicating people and no where to gather information independently . The benefits of having computers are that they are a way of communicating with friends and family that do not live in your area or that you just have not talked to in a while . They also teach hand - eye coordination which is good for almost anything . Lastly , they give people the ability to learn about other things in the world . In conclusion , computers have outstanding effects on people . First of all , in my perspective , having a computer , allows me to communicate to people I had met on past vacations . I can email , them and talk to them on social networks such as facebook . This is benefical to anyone that has lost touch with friends or even family . Being able to talk to friends I have not spoken to in a white , gives me and others the opportunity to catch up and reconnect . In conclusion , being able to communicate with others on a computer , is only I , of the many benefits a computer has ! Second of all , not only does having a computer allow you to talk to others but it can teach you hand - eye coordination as we will .

On the other hand , businessman , parents , and even teachers use the internet to learn about things around the world and to gather information to teach their classes . Overall , computers have many benefits such as they allow you to communicate with others , they teach you hand - eye coordination , and even allow you to learn about things and places around the world .

My @ NUM1 reason why I am against usage of computers is , the negativity , like for example too many pop ups come on the website your own and then they mini little advertisments like "" @ CAPS1 on me "" "" free trial "" . And that is not good for children to see when they are using the computer . My seocnd reason why I am against using computers is who is online when your up there . @ NUM2 out of @ NUM3 people use the computer every single day and @ NUM3 out of @ NUM5 people be up there chatting with young little girls and boys . And they older what then what they say . What I am trying say is these people are called "" @ CAPS2 "" . These people roam through the internet day and night trying to find little boys and girls . Just like I say earlier that is not good computer usage . The purpose of getting on the computer is look for information or play games no that other stuff . My final reason of being against computer is montoring , alot of parents do not watch their kids when they are on the computer , so most of the kids look at a lot of inapproiate sites or things that they should not look at . And that be their fought beacuse they should have parental lock up there . In conclusion , basically what I am trying to say is computers can be dangerous sometime because you do not always know what your clicking on and you can @ CAPS1 on the wrong thing and end up on a site that you do not want to be on .

Have you ever thought of how a computer is made or how every small part of a computer is installed ? we will , unfortunately I do not have the answers to these questions but I do have another quistion for you to think about . Are computer ' s bad for you ? we will , I think that they arn ' t because first of all , they teach us hand - eye coordination , give people the chance to learn about places and people that they have never seen or even heard of , and lastly the allow people to talk to faraway relatives or friends without ever having to go to them . As I was say in before , the computer gives people good eye - coordination . For example people usually are not very good catching a ball at first but of course if you keep on practicing you will get better . Same thing with the computer , at first you arnt very good or fast at typing but if you keep practicing you will gradually get quicker at it . Then this good habit will help you while your at school or at work . Second the computer gives people the ability to learn about places or people that they have never seen or heard about . For example some people might have yet not heard the warter falls , trails , or food ' s from @ ORGANIZATION1 . Another example is that mabey some people might not know about the belly dance came from @ LOCATION1 . or the big dragon came from @ LOCATION2 . The excelant source to find out all these things in a quick amount of time without having to . The computer is also excellent for elderly people are in weel chairs and can not take too much . Lastly , it let ' s people talk to far away relatives or family members online . This is better because then mabey a father went on a busines trip to another country and talking on the phone is really satisfying also you can forget about sending letters . It is always nice to greet a father , a mother , or even distant cousin online were you can see how much they have grown . I hope you you have taken my side on this judgement for it is very important to me .

8605,1498,1,"Dear Newspaper editor I would like to make @ CAPS3 about the benifits of owning a computer . For example you can learn many thing you would of never of been able too , you can also go in chat rooms and talk with friends or other people and it can even make teaching esyer too . Computers in many countres are standard and we use then to learn many things but if you bring one to the tribes in @ LOCATION1 it will look like a alein object but once they know how to use it it can open there eyes for ever many people in remote ribes and areas do not even know theres been a man on the meon . Another great thing about the computer is you can pay bills such as taxes , insurance , credit cards and othe payments which is good so if you can not get of your house or the place is closed you will not get late fees and it can even help you save large amounts of money too . Many people use the computer to socialize by joining online website such as @ CAPS1 , twitter and myspace were you can talk veiw pictures and see what friends are up to . Also on @ CAPS2 you can message friends too . Further more many people play games on the computer some are single player and some are online and have millions of players on at a time . you can also hook other gaming system up to your computer to play with other people and even yet hints and cheats too . The biggest reasons that computers are benifit though is that they revolutionized school now for homework instead of doing a work sheet you go on the computer and do it and print it out or email it to your teacher . Another reason the computer is amazing is that it makes research for projects and home work much more easyer , redrable and it ean give you a much more broader view of the topic . By far the best thing ahead the computer is the fact that many teachers use them to teach with and show videos . Therefore it is much easier to learn and under stand thing wich will help us in the future be successful . Also many kids pay less attention when a teaches is giving a lecture but when there is a computer playing a video it will grasp the students attention much better . These are all the reasons why I think the computer is a excellant invention and every family and school should own one I hope you will find my @ CAPS3 very persuading and puplish it .",8.0,223,3.6600535527193903,31.285714285714285,14,0.5079726651480638,5.0,1.5261958997722096,0.7345299214394703,0.03416856492027335,14.0
8606,490,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 you know someone who lives faraway from you ? Or have you ever used @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS3 ? These are only a few of the techniches a computer has . Computers benefitted society greatly . It helps people @ CAPS2 things such as allow people to talk to each other , goin skills from playing games , and it has images and it is easier . As I , mentioned , computers allow us to communicate with other people . This way , we do not have to talk to people in person . it would get annoying if every time we wanted to talk to someone of three things would happen without computers . those would be either getting trouble at school , memorizing a phone number and the dialing it , or talking to than in person . Clearly , computers make it easier to talk to people . Next , computers allow us to talk to faraway friends or family . You could write an e - mail or talk to them in a chat . This helped me because I talk to one of my friends in @ LOCATION1 and just recently sent an e - mail to my aunt . Without a doubt , computers make it easier for us to communicate with other people , no matter how far . Secondly , every computer that I have seen is able to play some sort of game , whether it be by a disk or on a website . These games can teach us many skills . The first skill we could learn is typing . just a few days ago , I was playing a game where you had @ NUM1 seconds to type as many words as you can , as fast as you can . If you make a mistake one second decreases off of your time . It also gets harder as you go , getting from just three letter words to five letter words to even seven letter words and so on . Also , a class that at @ CAPS4 . information processing , is about computer . Once we were finished with our assignments , we could play type to learn @ NUM2 . That is also a typing game . As you can see , some games can teach us how to type . Another type of games where you need guide - thinking to be able to win . This teaches nto be ready for almost anything . Also , it teaches us to process what is around you and decide in a decision . In real - life situations you @ MONTH1 only have a few seconds to react . Games such as these help in real - life situations . The last type of game is the tower defense . This shows us teenager to think like our lives depended on it . If we were to evr join the army and become some sort of captain , we would be able to organize our trops in the best mannor we could think of these tower defense games also teach us think and plan ahead .

Computers alow me to learn about new @ NUM1 , learning about cultures all over the world can be done by computers . The last way computers @ CAPS2 learning is by informing us about everyday thing like to get a stain out , how to pronounce a word , how to make a new dish , and much more . Computers are also crucial to communictaion . We use computers to talk to our freinds on facebook . You can also meet new people useing a pc . Everyone uses computer so you can basicly meet enyone . The last reason computers are important is for the commercial stand point computer help alot of small bussness out by letting than be known . Domestic seller and huge companies can compette for the same customer . Furthermore the internet generates alot money for people becausethey can use it as a cyber billboard . In conclusion the computer is usefull because of learning , communication , and comercial .

8608,389,1,"Dear newspaper , I had read your article about peoples opinion on the affects of computers . I believe that having computers are a very good thing . With them we can talk to others from far away , and fast . You can learn a lot too . It also teaches hand - eye coordination . My first reason why they are good is because you ran talk to others . Without computers it would be almost impossible to meet people from far away and talk to them so easily . They even have webcams so you can see each other . You can use @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 , webcams , or even a simple comment on facebook or myspace . @ CAPS2 or webcams are the quichest and maybe even coolest way . Secondly you can learn Computers have so many websites that give out alot of information and resent too . it is muchn easier to get on the internet and type something in then look threw a bunch of books . The internet has dictionaries , news stations , weather , history and where you can find things . With all that you do not even need books . They even have maps and you can print out directions . My final reason is because it teaches hand - eye coordination . When you first start using computers your normally pretty young , and sometimes you do not always type the fastest . Computers have become so advanced that there are even touch - screen and wireless mases . So when you first start you normaly look down to see what your writing , later , adults want you to look at the screen when that becames easy you know that your hand - eye coordination has grown alot better then when you stated . In conclusion I think that computers are a good part of everyday life and that there not bad . They are an easy communication between people , help you learn , and teach good and fast hand - eye coordination in kids .",8.0,167,4.24210759597619,14.857142857142858,21,0.5335463258785943,5.0,1.597444089456869,1.3127443531093743,0.025559105431309903,21.0

8613,1055,1,"To whom it @ MONTH1 concern , To many people it is so much fun but then they become so obsessed that they can lose so much that they loved . My stand is that computers hurt peoples . Money , weight and sleep . My opinion is my opinion but I will stand strong with what I have . My father is favorite is the financial deal . With five kids and one laptop who would want to be happy . With people sitting and staring at a computer game all day the bills just keep billing up until you lose everything , such as your house , family , money , ect . But who cares about them when you are obsessed with your computer . My favorite is the overweight problem . Yeah I agree it is nice to sit in a soft cushy chair with your computer and bowls of chips and boxes of pizza but sooner or later all that fatty food will catch up to you when you least expect it but will you get up and take a jog , run on a treadmill or go for a @ NUM1 walk . Probably not will that computer game running . That wright will keep coming until you can not even move . Sitting at a @ NUM2 will really have your eyes , brain , muscles and other important bodyparts due to lack of sleep and want for it . I can relate this to my brother with his dis . The be gets home , boom he is on it until maybe @ NUM3 or @ NUM4 o ' clock in the @ TIME1 . Eventually he is going to get sick and I am not to blame for it . When you sit at a computer than eventually you are going to make yourself sick and in some cases die if you were up that late . Now as a common teen to love to go on the computer but one thing I do not do is sit and watch movies or play games every hour of every day . I get outside and run so that I will not fall victim to weight . Financial , and body problems , like @ MONTH1 people do . So do not waste your life on a game or chat room get out there and do something like sports or just get some fresh air .",8.0,196,4.078154481057762,17.714285714285715,21,0.5254691689008043,5.0,1.4182305630026808,1.5751145914106568,0.0160857908847185,21.0
8614,1006,1,"I strolled into my bedroom , I noticed the computer sitting on a wonder desk . I thought that computers are very helpful . There are many controversies on whether computes benefit or do not benefit society . My opinion on this topic is that computers are useful and I support this technology . Computers are excellent tools that could help students with work in school . For instance , this year I had a sciences project about how my hobbies interests are related to science . One of my interests in reading , @ CAPS1 I had to research about how reading a simple back can be related to science . I went on the internet , typed in my question about reading , and two seconds later thousands of results up . I had even gotten some pictures too . A couple of days later after I had handed in my project , I recieved it back . I had gotten a @ NUM1 on this project ! @ CAPS1 being able to use a computer really boosted my grade in science . Without the internet , I probably would not have been able to get on A on this . As you can see , computers can help students with projects , etc . in school . Using this technology can help you reconnect with friends and family members . In elementary school , my friend @ PERSON1 had moved away to @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS2 . I had no way of communicating with her until I found a program on the internet that lets you chat with people . Both of us had been using this and we have been able to talk for on end . I do not see @ PERSON1 as often as I had used to , but with my computer wide open in my bedroom I can chat online with her almost everyday . Computers can help re - establish old relationships with friends and family . @ CAPS1 communicating on these are also another benefit . Using computers can help enrich peoples minds . For example , in school we use a program called , "" @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 . "" @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 involves you playing games that help you @ CAPS3 , and tests when you are ready to take them . @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 has been helping us practice for the @ ORGANIZATION1 ' s . After taking multiple tests in subjects such as science , math , and language arts , I now feel confident about taking the @ ORGANIZATION1 ' s and I believe I am going to do we will on these tests . As you can tell , the tool of @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 on the computer can benefit your school grades . The effect computers have an people are that they help and benefit the society . I think that more citizens should own computers because they can expand your knowledge . I am clearly in favor of owning and using computers .",8.0,210,4.809970315723003,14.258064516129034,31,0.4740406320541761,6.0,1.5823927765237018,1.4690640517640443,0.02031602708803612,31.0

Also , it makes home work , and finding information a lot easyier as we will . Last but not least when you have nothing else to do , you can play games , and watch videos from online . One of the best things about computers is going online and chatting with @ CAPS1 friends . Even if the are across the country , you can still chat with them , for free ! Also , if you can not get in touch with them , you can send them a @ CAPS2 - mail , and as soon as they log on , they will get your message . Best of all , when you forget to write your home work down , you can go online , and ask one of your friend what it was . Besides talking to people , you can do your homework on a computer as we will . All you have to do is make a word document , and type with the keys . Let me just say this is a lot better than having to write with a pencil . Not to mention , typing a paper is a lot neater . Also , if you are doing a report on something , all you have to do is look it up on the internet , and you will get endless information about it , all on your computer ! Last but not least , you can play games on your computer . Whenever someone is bored doing nothing they can just turn on a computer , and play their favorite game . Not only is it fun , but it teaches hand - eye coordination as we will . Some people say they do not have the money for games , but little do they know , there are millions of free online games , that any age can play . This is great on a boring day when you have nothing else to do . In summary , the effects computers have on people is they help make everyday life easyier . You can chat with people from long distances , and it even makes home work much easyier to complete . Not to mention it has fun games for people to play when there bored , or have nothing to do .

Another reson is they teach hand - eye coordination . The last reson is we can talk to frteinds and meet new people .

We can learn wat kind of plantation grow there for food for example tropical places grow bananas and cocanuts . We can learn wat they eat like in @ LOCATION1 they eat many beans a lot of there food have beans even there salads . We can find out there language as we will maybe they talk spanish like in @ LOCATION2 . You can also teach hand - eye coordination becase it involves using your fingers and eyes to see what you are typing . You use ur hands on evry thing while typing wether you are typing or you are using the mouse . But it is not just for learning things it is also for freinds becase of al these sites like myspace , facebook , aim , webchat . The posibilities are endless u can even play games . If you do not know someone on face , book , or myspace that is okay it is a great way to meet new people and new freinds .

I say this because it alows kids to be bullied at all hours of the day , it takes away from their exercise , and it gives then less time to study and do school work .

Experts say that @ NUM1 out of every @ NUM2 kids have thing to use to talk on line , but the also say that @ NUM3 in @ NUM4 of thoes kids are bullyed on line . Also every year you hear someone or them , we will most of the time it is because of @ CAPS1 . In fact I heard on the news that half of their kids were bullyed online .

Another bad thing about the computer is that it replace exercise . A text A and @ CAPS2 football scout said "" every year their are less less people who play sports because of video game or computers . "" @ CAPS3 the obesity rate of kids has gone up in america and many agree that the cause computers taking place of exercise . Also people think that you get better hand eye coordination but most leaders agree that you do not because it is not your hand that is moving it is your mouse .

They taly to my grandparents , then friends , and even use it to arrange events with other people . My use it when people are hurt and I know some people use it to learn about magazine subscription and other thing to buy .

For one computers help with entertainment . Second of all , they are very information . Lastly , computers make life less stressful . In the following paragraphs I will explain on @ CAPS2 reasoning . Firstly , computers give entertainment . Now I can see why people say we should go out side more and excersize but , what are supposed to do on a rainy day ? we will , you could go on the computer ! Plus , computers give children enjoyment and make them happy , instead of being sometimes . Another reason why computers are good , is they can give children modivation . Say you are child really wants to play a new game on his favorite website , but his homework is not done you could tell him if he gets his homework done he can play on the computer . Also , you could give him a time limit on @ CAPS1 too . Lastly , for a teenager or older they are more social than little children . They go on things like ; twitter , facebook and myspace . Computers is probably their @ NUM1 or @ NUM2 way they communicate . Unfortuneatley . Some people abuse these rights and people get in trouble . But the good thing is you can customize you page so that will not happen . Any way children become more social . Secondly , computers are informational . They can tell you a lot by just the touch of keypad and the click of a mouse . You can search someone or something across the whole world . If you want to know the mother and how to prepare for @ CAPS1 , just look @ CAPS1 up and do what you have to . Also , if you find out something new tell people , you can spread the knowledge . Thirdly , computers make things less stressfull . which would you rather do , type or @ NUM3 pages ? we will I ' d type ! computers make things more organized so @ CAPS1 ' s easier to find things . @ CAPS1 also makes @ CAPS1 easier to find things , like files because you can just do to "" @ CAPS2 documents "" and find @ CAPS1 .

Teens should be outside playing sports or hanging out with friends and family . But instead they are addicted to the world wide web and games and websites throughout it . Therefore , the computer and the concept of surfing the web is bad because it consumes childrens much and because educationally computers can give the wrong information . Until the late @ DATE1 ' s , @ ORGANIZATION3 laptops and desktop @ CAPS2 did not exist in @ CAPS1 opinion , this would have been better . For example . children teens and even adults use the computer more than they should nowadays . At this age middle schoolers and high - schoolers should be focused on their grades and their . But instead , they get too addicted to @ CAPS3 , @ CAPS4 and @ CAPS5 that they forget about their school work and their priorities , and their grades start to slip . Even sudlts have this problem . For instance , buisness people , accountants and assistants will consistently be checking their emails . Also , people who work at a desk or in a cudical all day are almost always on the computer . In other words , I believe that jobs should cut dwn on how many workers they have on a computer , and family homes should cut down on the amount of time each member spends online . Another reason I think computers effect people in a bad way is because educationally computers can give false information . For example , people could insect their own perspective of an idea on websites such as wikipedia and @ ORGANIZATION2 . If a student was doing a project or just homework and decided to surf the web for some @ ORGANIZATION2 or information they do not know if their information is correct . I believe this means that the internet and the web do not beat books or history .

Family is a very important factor in computers because if you have not seen the person you can tell how they are progressing in life . If that is not the case you can meet new people .

8639,255,1,"Dear Newspaper editor , Computers have been a great advancement in technology , but some people think otherwise . It is a great thing to have some people say but others think it is a hazard to health . I think it is an excellent thing to have . I have come up with @ NUM1 reasons to support my opinion . Computers help you keep in touch with distant friends and / or family , they assist you in research , and they even let you do shopping . Firstly , if you have any relatives or friends that live far away computers have websites such as aol or facebook & myspace that you can use to keep in touch with them . Most of them are free to create an account so you do not need to worry about monthly bills for them . So this is a lot better than driving and paying gas for visiting . Computers even have webcams for video chat . With video chat you can see each other & talk at the same time , that is amazing . Secondly , you can search the web for research . If you have a project and you need more information than books give you then just use google or ask . com . You can easily find the details and information you need . All this takes is just a couple minutes , which is alot better than reading for an hour or time . Lastly , if you really want something or need it just shop online . For example if you are a really cool toy that you want to buy for your daughter or son , but it is not for sale in stores then buy it off the internet . They even ship your item fast . I like buying off the internet . When I really wanted a bike I saw my mom end up getting it for my birthday . In conclusion , computers are very handy . If you need information , talk to someone , or buy something it is got it . I use computers a lot . I think they are very great to have .",8.0,170,4.345850961080892,13.833333333333336,24,0.5105105105105106,5.0,1.5165165165165164,1.7661506484543552,0.006006006006006006,24.0

Ever since I had brought down the habbit od being a @ CAPS3 user my guardian has stated the light bill gas decreased .

I myself would not accept invitation to could not go to movies with friends and I would not help around the house . These were the main three thing I would not do .

Even though they can be use for many things like research ! For example , if you are a student you @ MONTH1 need to do a project . Computers would be easier for you to collect research than a book . Another reason why computers are educational is because you can use them to read . You can buy virtual books that you can read right on your computer . Not only is that education but that also helps the environment because you would be saving paper . Sometimes you @ MONTH1 simply be curious about something , your computer will be right their for you to use . Computers also have another positive effect on people , they can be used for communication . Nobody likes a distant family , but with a computer you can communicate with family and friends from all over the world ! This effect is positive because it helps everyone stay in touch . Many people have very busy lives and do not have time in write a letter or make phone call . So , instead those people could just quickly and easily send a email no instant message to who ever they need to talk to . Some experts are concerned that people too much time on the computer and less time excercising , enjoying nature and interacting both friends and family . These experts do not realize that you can use a computer to instead with friends and family . A computer many family thing . You can watch movie as a family or multiplayes games together on the computer . on the computer is a postive effect because while doing on the computer as a family you would for example , using a computer to be entertaind is safer than doing something entertaining . Where you and your family would be to many dangers . There are various reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people . Computers can be used to learn , communicate , and entertain . Those are only my main reasons they are many more . And that is why I support advances in technology and behave computers have a positive effect on people .",8.0,170,4.605917888399733,15.269230769230768,26,0.4271356783919598,6.0,1.7839195979899498,1.3096910973393818,0.007537688442211055,26.0
8643,1284,1,"I think that the advances of technology to the computer are great and more beneficial than bad . Say you struggle at school and need serious help , you can turn to a computer for help , say you have a dear friends that a week ago moved to florida , you can use the computer to contact them .

School one of many students least favorite activities , yet you can use the internet to help you out , @ CAPS1 ! say you are in geometry and it is kicking you are butt , got to @ PERSON1 academy for informational videos . Maybe you are a third grade teacher and the little kids are driving you nuts , go to @ LOCATION1 , and educational and fun website .

What if it is a really rainy rainy day and you are tired and want to learn about faraway places in a logical person ' s head , the internet pops into their head . Think of the computer as a big easy to acess library , type something into a search engine and it pops up . What if you are in germany and you are hungry , oh no ! Everything is in @ CAPS2 ! open your laptop for easy translation . All of these things support that the internet makes learning about foreign places easy . And finally , communication is really easy , with the internet because , there use emails , skypes , chatrooms etc . internet ' s middle name is communication . What if your phone is gone and there is an emergency , you can get the email ! What if a burgalor cuts the phone lines and sneaking your house e - mail @ NUM1 . And finally internet can be used to call @ PERSON2 and tell him , "" do not forget the red bull "" as he leaves . Those are some of the reasons the internet is good for communication .

Insted of social networking sites you can actualy go and see the person or if they are far away you can call them or write them a letter . To find out about current events you can read the newspaper or watch the news . If you like using computer disign programs try drawing a real picture instead . Lastly if you download a lot of music you can just but a cd or better yet go to see the band live . Face it you can not do ehything on a computer that actualy requires the computer . Artificial simulations are no mach for the real outdoors . On a computer all you can do is watch and even that is nothing compared to the real thing it is just a snapshot of it . Outside you can the gentel breses the warm sun the cool grass , you can smell fresh pine and clean air . You can hear all the other cretures surounding you . Going outside is better for you to . Outside you get exersize and vitimin @ CAPS2 while inside you get fat lazy and sick . can not you see how great the outdoors are ? Computers can do more harm than good . They can show children inapropriat pictures and talk about inapropriat topics . They are even now using computers to sell illegal drugs . Children allso often use the internet irrisponsibly and to things that can dissrupt frendships and get them into truble . The computer has also made it alot easyer for kidnappers to find children and kidnapp them . They do this by pretending to be the childs peer then using the information the child him he will make almost a garunteed kidnapping . This is happening more and more frequently . The computer is not as helpful as you thought . Computers are not realy benificial to our socity . They have no rel use that is not alredy taken care of . The can not replace the real outdoors .

Just by doing that you lose a lot of weight and not gaining weight on the computer . So go exercise and lose weight because it is good for you ! Computers also prevent you from getting freash air and playing outside . When your are outside you see that playing is much better than just pressing buttons and clicking everywhere . On the computer . You do not even have to play outside , you can just walk with someone or just sit on the grass and talk . The computer prevents you from doing all of this fun activities outside . Spending time with your family is a huge activity that your computer is prevting you to do . You are on the computer for an hour and your family is having a barbeque .

Computers make work easier they can do things people can not like solve difficult problems , and kids like playing games on them . Computers make work easier and neater .

Studies have also shown that people who use computers to do work finish faster and have up to @ PERCENT1 more free time to do whatever they want . Computers also have e - mail , which allows you to send work that you have done to your boss without printing it and wasting paper . Computers can solve difficult problems that people either can not do , or do not want to waste their time doing . If you need to solve a math problem you use a calculated or a computer . So you do not have to figure it out yourself . I have to do a lot of math problems for homework and I think it is much easier to use a calculator . My last reason why computers are good is that kids like playing games on them . A lot of people say that kids should not play computer games but some of them are educational . Even non - educational games help kids to have fun and have something to look forward to after their work is done . @ PERCENT2 of kids say that they are happier when they have something fun to look forward to , and happier kids do better work .

I will now like to elaborate my reasons further . First of all , going on the internet and search sites help you learn and find information on anything you want . On the internet you can even ask questions , and they will probably be answered . You my even use information on the computer for a report statistics show @ PERCENT1 of people who do reports , find their facts on the internet .

One way is to make a certain account where you can meet people who aim or a different account . Another way is go on a website where you can pen - pal someone from a different place in the world . The final way is to download something where they can send instant messages to people all over the world . Do you have a project where you to learn about another country or another explorer ? we will you can use the computer to learn about the place or the person . I am saying this because that will helps us with all the work we do for school . Computers also help you with your school work by helping you with homework . I am saying this because with nobody home when nobody there when you come home from school who is going to help you with your homework you can use a website that helps you understand the material better . Do you know where your family comes from ? A way you can find out with your family come from is use a website to find where your family comes from . For example , @ LOCATION1 is a helpful website to learn who they really were in life , were they fight in a war . You can find this all out on the computer . Another way is you can ask your parents the name of someone and type there name in google . com . There are many reasons why we should could keep computers but here are some , interact with people , learn about other places and learn about family . I hope you understand this better .",8.0,140,4.203872578068396,16.666666666666668,21,0.3988603988603989,5.0,1.5954415954415957,1.6152502650882519,0.014245014245014244,21.0
8662,554,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , @ CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is that computers have a good effect . it is good for education mind exercise and communication all over the world . It could @ CAPS2 be bad because it would keep you from getting exircise , being with your family and being healthy . But I still think that there are ways to use computers without the bad cause . Some ways computers are good for you are that you can get a better education when you have websites with so much information . Sometimes these information are flase but if you find the websites you can get the rite information . With all of this information you ran exircise your mind to do better in life . You can @ CAPS2 talk to people on the other side of the earth and get more inforamtion from them . If I were to say computers are bad for you I would I say that it keeps you from getting enough or maybe any exircise . Computers @ MONTH1 be the reason why ther are so many obese people in the @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS2 when computers are use too much people part from their family and go into different fantasy worlds that somethimes get you addicted to them . And staying for too long on the computer cause prolems . You can get hurt by just sitting for a long amount of time at once . Being on the computer for too long can @ CAPS2 cause eye problems where you will begin to lose your sight and will need glasses which will get thicker as you keep looking at the computer screen for hours and days . But even though computers cause so many problems we can prevent them by using the computer to help us . People do not get enough exircise but with the help of computers they can @ CAPS2 find times and ways to exircise so that they can stay healthy . They can @ CAPS2 find information about how much time should be spent on the computer to not have sight decrease or worse . Some people live far away from their family so computers really help them stay in touch and to be able to see each other . In conclusion I think that computers are more beneficial then harmfull because they give you alot of information for everything and you can comunicat with people all over the world . And computers can help you prevent those things that are bad for you by showing you ways to use computer that will not harm you .",8.0,181,4.159711690273674,22.0,19,0.4319809069212411,5.0,1.5871121718377088,0.8314743880097293,0.026252983293556086,19.0

A pound no imagin how much wiget you will gain if you do that every day alot ! My next reason why I think computers are in a way bad is because when you are the computer too long your eyes start to hurt and your hands start to cramp and everything starts to hurt to much typing and looking at the same thing for along to can make you have eye problems and can also give you something in your hands and then you will not to be able to do anything with your hands for along time because it will start hurting . My last reason why i think computers in a way are bad because it can mess your computers up it can over heat or just down because you have ben on it for too long . It can also get a virese then you will just have to get a whole new computer @ CAPS1 you can see there are plenty of reasons why I think computers are kinda bad .",8.0,118,2.073646702045628,52.8,5,0.4452830188679245,4.0,1.490566037735849,-0.0,0.026415094339622643,5.0
8664,1344,1,"In the world we live in now , everything is getting technilogical . In my own opinion , it is a good thing . Using computers has been very helpful to our society . They give people the opportunity to research things fast and easily , they save trees , and they are a wonderful way to communicate with people . First , computers are great to use for research instead of books that waste tree . A few years ago , kids would get a school project on a certain country and the thing that would came to mind is the library . But , nowadays it is computers . Sure , of course books are very helpful , but so is the internet , plus it is much faster and easier to find to find the information you are boking for . You can learn about a place before visiting it with a click of a button and learn about places far away . It really is magical . Next , using computers saves trees . With a computer we do not have to keep cutting down so many trees for books and paper . Another can now sell their books online and people are able to read them right . Honestly , there really is no reason to keep making books . Even students can do their home work , test and quizzes online ! I think it is a mirical and it is so amazing to see how much our world has changed in only about @ NUM1 years . Finally , computers are great to communicate with people far away . Some people have family in the war who they do not see for months or maybe years . With a computer you can get emails that get deliveres to the person right after being sent . Or you can even webcam and actually see the person face to face ! It must be hard not being able to see your loved ones everyday , which is why a computer is very helpful . Even to those who have a family member away on a business trip or that live in another state / country . Computers are very helpful , especially today with everything going on in our world . With computers we can online research , save trees , and communicate with people far away . So , in my opinion computers do benefit society .",8.0,180,4.491709681108544,14.68,25,0.4891304347826087,5.0,1.576086956521739,1.4729350396193692,0.010869565217391304,25.0
8665,751,1,"I would like to state on my behalf that I do not agree that computers are good for society . There are three reasons why I do not agree . Many people will not enjoy the outdoors , @ CAPS1 people will spend @ CAPS1 there time on the computer , and a lot of people will gain wheight to inactivity . When you sit on a computer you do not get off of for a while , why , because you are haveing fun . when you are haveing fun you will not stop wat you are doing , @ CAPS2 do not pay attention . Eventually you will get hooked and play on the computer rather than go outside and have fun with your friends . @ CAPS4 will just take up all of your time . @ CAPS2 when you are bored you find anything that you can possibly do , rather than be bored . Many people are thinking this is a good time to go on the computer but @ CAPS3 you bored you will stay on the computer until you have something to do . My mother always tells me when I am bored not stay home because @ CAPS4 will get worse . There is always something you can do that dosn ' t you just have to look harder . My last reason is that when you sit at a computer and you are fingers , you gain your wheight you I read @ NUM1 children in every years will be obese , not because @ CAPS4 runs in the family but because of inactivity . Inacitivity means not active activity . @ CAPS3 you calories you will gain weight @ CAPS6 wheight is unhealthy and you can stop the problem by just finding something spend your whole life on the computer .

Because they help people learn about faraway places . Lets say a family is planning a vocation to @ LOCATION1 . And they do not no anthing about it so they go on a computer and they could book a reserucition for a hotel . My second opinion on computer is that . you have a project for school and you need the right information . that is not in books go on a computer . Lets say you have to do taxes online because your cripplede ( @ CAPS1 ) so you might wanna @ NUM1 www . turbotax . com . and you hale your taxes infront of your eyes .

They can confront the situation about three child . and last ley my last conclusion . that is what i feel about computer . That we need them to communicate to other people . To do assignments for a job or school . Or to learn about places that you never been to before or would like to vacation to . And the reason why i feel like that is because i passion for computer .

Lastly it can even increase you chances of finding a job or helping out your job . For most people education is very important to but since kids do not stay in school @ NUM1 they use the computer to teach to kids kids can learn about other places . This benefits us because we ' re learning something and growing out our knowledge . Also kids can do their projects . For example writing on essay , their science fair project and so on . Lastly kids can learn about people from other times . For example famous musicians long ago , celebrities , legends , hall of famers etc .

8669,167,1,"Dear local newspaper , @ CAPS1 are beinging questioned if the are good for our society or not . I would have to say that they are good and bad you really can not pick a side . These good because children and teens can get the information they need to teach in school , it allows people to chat with others in different places , and it helps hand - eye cordanation . Those were the good here are some bad things about compters . People spend to much time on the computer instead of exercising , they do not ' get to enjoy nature , and people stop interacting with friends and family . Anyone can pick a side . I just can not , because i can relate to both sides . For example . one of the good reasons about computers was that you can chat ' s with other people around the world . I can relate to that because when i live here in @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 my mom and stepdad live in @ LOCATION1 , @ LOCATION2 so i do not see them much but thanks to computer i can chat . With them when ever i want to . Honestly i would not know how my life would be like if i did not have a computer and i was not able I @ CAPS4 now . Although , can also to one or the bad things about computers , which is that people spent to much time on the them . I can relate to that and so could of the other we will , because when i around @ NUM1 because go to a after school , go straight on my laptop and around @ NUM2 . When my grandma @ NUM3 pm . She always comes in and "" Your on that thing to much you your hands ! "" in her . So in my opinion I believe that coumpters can be good for our socity and bad ; for me there is no side to take .

8670,537,1,"Dear , local Newspaper , I hear that you think computers have an effect on people . Will I disagree with what you say . I think computer will help us learn , and do things faster . Haveing computers helps the community learn more . My first , reason I think we should keep computers because it helps people with there hand eyes coordination for jobs . With the skills of typing you can work at places like the city of @ LOCATION1 where they type every day and work hard . They also learn more and more facts about the sociatis . Without knowing how to type you @ MONTH1 not get any top class jobs . My second , reason telling us that computers are helpful is that it helps your children do better in school by learning how to type for high school , and learning math , sce , social studies and language arts . Computers also helps kids at young age do math and other with their character , like dora , @ ORGANIZATION1 , elmo , and others . So learning on computer can help you learn and have fun at the same time . Which i know your parents would like . Even new born babys can learn how to read , write and do math and grow up and can be president one day . My third , reason is that it helps send things all over the world . Without computers we would have to do it old fashion style . Also with computers you can talk to family member that live far away from you ( In state or country ) and you have not see them in a long time . Or you can chat with old school friends from back in the day . You can also buy thing off the computer . In my conclution I told you that computers can not effect people by telling you that your child can do better learning and parents also . I also add that it helps you get jobs and help you with your hand and eye cordination in school and out .

I took a survey at my school with the same exact question and @ PERCENT2 of the kids said that hanging out with friends and family is much more than spending all of your time on the computer , and there are three reasons why they said that . First , instead of talking to people on the computer , than in person . Next it is unhealthy , and lastly alot of bad things can happen on the internet . So , if you are interested in this topic please keep on reading and I will prove that the computer is not a good way to spend your spair time . Do you know what computers were intended to do ? Computers were you people , but have for one second that instead of interacting with people you should interact with the people around you . Instead of going on facebook / myspace to talk to your friends , just them over . If you do that it is not only more fun , healthier for you . So next time anything else just think the other options . In my last paragraph did not I say that hanging out with friends is much more healthier then being ? we will I was absolutly @ PERCENT1 ! Did you know that when you waist your only hurting yourself ? we will , you are when all your doing is sitting down stairing at a screen you are not doing anything to help your self because you are get absolutly exercise .

First of all computers have a negative effect on people because it causes them to get exercise . For example , there are many football , soccer and baseball games practicingg these they will just computer on the webcam all night . Another way is that you can get work done . WIthout even leaving your house . You can shop online , stay home and work online , and even go to college those things include getting out around , but now you can just day and do those things and be lazy . Second , the computer causes you to interact with people less . Now , when family or friends . i went over my I sat right and she did not even look at me playing computer games . i know that a lot more kids too because I was reading in a magazine that @ PERCENT1 of interacting with their kids as much as they got a computer . Lastly , i think the computer has a negative effect because it them . It distracts kids conversations first of all when people to talk with someone on the computer it is very hard because , they are absorbent in they are doing . Secondly , the computer distracts kids from homework . I know this first hand , because wherever I have in type up assignments I get and end up going on different websites , and not getting my work done . lastly , it distracts kids from household chores . Some kids just put them to the side and forget to do them because they are budy playing game or surfing the web . i know that if I did I ' d get in big trouble . Those are the reasons why I think the computer has a negative effect on people . Because , it causes them to get less exercise , they do not interact with people , as much , and it distract them . So unless you want all those things happening to you , I suggest you spend less those on the computer !",8.0,161,4.105927579112399,17.95,20,0.44722222222222224,6.0,1.5666666666666669,1.4387586809150084,0.008333333333333333,20.0

Computers are everywhere in fact , seven out of ten families on my street own atleast one computer in their household . So why would we want to take them away ? Computers are too useful . Computers are not only fun , but very resourceful . Anybody with a question faild easily hop on a computer , research it on google . com and find what they were looking for within minutes . I remember when I had a cut on my arm that looked weird , my mom was to heal a wound . She researched it and got how to the mark go away . The computer only benefits you in a way . Is most likely them you will be staying at in two weeks and realize they do not have a pool ! Lastey , without computers we would have no communication with new or different people . Computers are great for communicating . People are able to comunicate through twitter , @ CAPS2 , and even youtube . The sites all help people make new friends online almost like pen pals on the internet . Also , if the majority of your family lived in @ LOCATION1 and you were stuck in @ CAPS3 , you could easily talk to them through email or an instant messanger . Hopefully now you have a better understanding of how much of a lifesaver the computer is . Maybe you could even make next @ STATE1 about how resourceful , beneficial and social computers are !",8.0,162,4.01383885052176,14.111111111111109,18,0.6352941176470588,6.0,1.6588235294117648,1.4955380299191112,0.031372549019607836,18.0
8682,854,1,"My opinion is that the more that we stay on the computer . The more we get lazy . One reason that I say this is because , a computer is a big handy person in reality . Second reason is , people stay in the house sitting down on the computer other than exercising . The third reason is , people just sit in the house , and an ' t enjoy fresh air with their loved ones . First , the reason why I say a computer is a big handy person because it does most of the things a human can do . That can lead a person to being very lazy . Just too sit in the house and go to websites . It has a big effect on a humans life . The computer technology have contecll over a huge population of recae . It really make miss out on half of their day . Second , people stay in the house on the computer other than exercising . it is very unhealthy for a person to sit down at a computer all day . The person has to eat so , basicly they eat and sit back down at the computer . It can get out hand because the computer allows people to grace food online . So that right there is an example of people not getting ecersise , and being lazy . You need to get your ecersise dayly . So people that does not get their ecersise need to start . Instead of sitting down on the computer all day . Third , many people over whole world have a lot of love one ' s that they care about and love . "" But "" they dnt get time to be with them , because they are always on the computer . The computer should not take you away from you outdoor life . Okay , so what you can talk fo your friend and family over the computer . it is never like seeing them in person . Go outside and have fun and happy memories with your family . Because the computer is just words being texted . it is nothing like being said . I garrented you that . If you spend time with you are family then you will want to do it again . While your going out excersise and be interacting . In conclusion , if you are allways on the compute that is not good . Just take a few hours out of the day and ecersise . Go out and have a marvelous day . Because the computer does not do nothing but make you lazirer ( @ CAPS1 YOU ) . If your allways on the computer just be sure that you get your ecersise and your time with your family . It will make your a better person !",8.0,178,5.066744670121795,12.055555555555555,36,0.4091954022988506,5.0,1.5264367816091955,1.3297455265134746,0.013793103448275862,36.0

One last example is ; when you want to stay updated on your favorite sport team , you do not have to go to their game you just have to go to their web site . In my opinion I say that @ CAPS2 , computers do have and effect on us but a good reason . I am a sports fan so I play a lot of sports . I use the computer offer for fun and research . It dosen ' t have an effect on me . It dosen ' t effect at all because I still exercise a play with my friends very often , like everyday . There is no reason to why people can not use computers quite often . Computers do not have a positive effect sometime , but it does not have a negitive effect sometime either . I exercise , enjoy nature and interact with friends and family too . I also use the computer often . Experts should not be concerned with people using computers too much .",8.0,156,4.4172943646715765,13.958333333333336,24,0.4642857142857143,5.5,1.5773809523809523,1.5632020899844858,0.02083333333333333,24.0

Using the computer could limit this time , and that probably isn ' @ CAPS1 healthy being in the house all day .

I totally agree with this . But some people do not like the computer because they spend more time on it then going outside . Here are ny thoughts on the computer . First of all , teh computer is a great way to look up the news . You can find more news and weather faster then you can on teh television . if you want to find the news , just got to awebsite that you think has news . I am find out what weather is today , what happens throughout the day that @ MONTH1 be shocking to everyone , and find out about celebrities . All this at a push of a button , and a click of the mouse . Secondly , the computer is like a tutor . Either your having trouble on homework , or you just want to knoe a simple fact , the computer is for you . Just search up soemthing you want to know on a search engine and you will have your answer . This amy not seen that important , but it is when you are anxious to learn . Lastly , the computer is the famous way of communicating around the globe . Whether it is facebook , myspace , aim , you can tlak to your distant or close family and friends . You might think , "" oh tha ' s what a phone is for "" ? we will all of these websites are free . Yeah , I said it free . There is also skype . Skype is where you can actually see the person you are talking to . Yes , the wonderful world of technology . So now you know that a computer can teach you things . it can find you news , and it can help you communicate across the globe . Now your thinking , "" People spend too much time on the computers right "" ? This is where independnece comes in . Get off or it . it is your decision to stay on it , not the computers .

I find these are resons that show that computers do not have a bad effect on people . Imagin you are on facebook and you type in your best friend from high schools name she pops up and you a on net . The next day she is on happy you are connected . that is she kind of thing that happens everday people reconnect , this not only happens on facebook , not all over the internet !

Say if you were @ NUM1 years old and when computers come out you bought one and went on it every day instead of being fit . Then if you have no exersize then you will get bigger and bigger . Another reason if you would only use computers for research I say this because there is no reason to go on your computer all day a good reason to go on the computer would be if you have some kind of project for school or a job instead of just using your computer for facebook or myspace . Then there is some kind of diesese that can happen to your if it does the same thing to many times . Your do not want to do that because if you do not use computer that much and you play some kind of sport like football , baseball , or any other kind of around some place . Also if kind of surgery on it and that will cause you from doing almost everything with that one hand . My last reason go on the computer your viruses connected to it . If you do that then mabe your computer will lost everything on it . Then you have to get a new computer and everything all . If you bought a new computer and you got somebody can hack your computer and get all of the information from it . The information then they like how . And if you do not know person you do not know what they can do . So I hope you dont buy something that has a really bad virus else like that .

You can get in contact with people , if you have a question you can look it up and you can do your job on a computer . I think that these reason will have you positive too . Many people like computers and have one . My first reason is you can get in toch with friends and family . I think this is a good reason because if your grandmother lives in @ LOCATION2 you do not want to drive there every time you want to see her when you live in @ LOCATION1 . You would use the computer to live chat with her so you wouldent have to drive all the doun there . If you wanted to you could plan a day to go and see her . You would use a computer to get in touch with friends . If you needed to ask them a question about the homework they could answer it . That is my first reason why computers have a positive way on people . My second reason is if you have a computer you can look up questions that you would have . If you needed to know some thing for a big report and none of your friends are up you can look up your computer . Computers can help you so much if you need an answer . If you didet hav a computer if you would be so hard to do stuff . That is why I think that computer can answer your questions . My third reason is you can work on the computer . If your a stay at home mom ya can work on the computer to handle finances . A lot of people work on the computer to save the envirment . When I grow up I will probaly work on the computer because it is easer . That is why I think that you can work on the computer .

8716,1783,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 several reasons on way I that advances in technology are harmful to our socitey is because it opens doors to strangers on the outside world . it is also takes you away from family and friends . Lastly it also takes you away from enjoying life outside of the internet . One of my severl reasons on way I feel advanced technology is harmful to our socitey is because it opens doors to strangers @ CAPS2 teens , adult ' s and etc . The probem with this is that you never really know who is on the other side of that door , that chat room people can miss guide you into thinking there someone who there not . @ CAPS2 example theres a show called dateline . This show is about how young teens put there selev ' s online and grown or young men click on a picture of you and that opens up a chat line or as I say opening a door , you do not know who is on the other side of that door . So these men online makes these teens trust them and make them feel safe if they are a friend you "" hey can I come over sometime ? "" you this young teen thinking that is your friend says yea sure . do not forget you do not see his picture so he come ' s over and most of three men are looking @ CAPS2 a quick fix . If you know what I mean . This is what go ' s on during dateline t . v show just imarge how many other kids or teens are out there doing the same thing the difference is they do not get caught . Secondly on why is harmful to our socitey is because it takes you away from your family and friends . It takes you away from your kid ' s family because that will start to fill as if you love that computer more then them . It take you away friends because they might say hey let ' s go out to the mall or @ CAPS2 a drink you will probably say check up on somethings online . This will one move slowly away from you , all over a computer you will start to lose the people most important to you . My last reason on why you can harm society with teconogly is because it takes you away from living your own life and doing thing ' s you wanna do like online is a bunch of stuff that everybody else say ' s is cool . Do what you think and feel is cool . @ CAPS2 example if someone posted something saying @ NUM1 guys lodon is so cool you gotta go there but you have always wanted to go to @ LOCATION1 , @ CAPS3 thing is that you do get to have enough air outside like your skin will get pail and icky and this is why I feel that way . In covlsion all though some people might think that advanced tencogly is good we will cleary there not because they open doors to danger , take you away from friends and family .

Most children are addicted to computer games . @ CAPS1 are @ PERCENT1 of children who are addicted to computers . For some reason , computers had a lot of effects on people . It might affect children ' s education or it might be the cause why your bills of electricity went higher . The worst of having computer at home , it can be a reason for millions of teenagers that got killed for always talking online with people they do not know . Computers are sometimes dangerous for people . Do people still need computer ? Having computer at home is not good specially to children . This is because computers can affect their education . Parents do not want that to happen to their children . A lots of uneducated children that stay home or do drugs in the street . Yes computer can help them for their studies or computer can help them for their studies or projects but other children in the computer because they just want to play games . that is why a lot of them did not learn anything at school but they learn a lot in the computer games . They should stop the computer games . Also , having computers at home can be the cause of people ' s electricity bills that went higher than they had @ DATE1 when they did not have computers . Other people think that computers can not give you any problem but computers works with electricity and pay for the electricity bills . If you have @ MONEY1 for your electricity bill @ DATE1 year when you did not have computer , it might go high to @ MONEY2 for your bill that now you have the computer . it is a big problem for you .

Talking online and meeting up with strangers people you do not know can be a reason of your lost . Parents should not have computers at home unless they will use it but it needs to be at their room where children can not use it . Now is the time to agree ! Do we need computers at home ? Can we live without the computer ? We do not need computers at home and yes we can live without the computer . We can do any activities with our family , exercise for our health , go picnic with friends or we have fun go on vacation with the whole family .

Also because it is another source of communication . Another reason is , the computer helps kids get their work done faster . Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers . First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands . @ CAPS4 example you heard about the @ CAPS1 that happen in @ LOCATION1 by t . v . But what if you wanted to get more information about it . All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information . Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that . Another example is communication . The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person . That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day ( me ) so that their of communication . Also you can go on website @ CAPS2 , @ CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends . Some people prefer to have penpals . A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry , more you have @ NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers . My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @ CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions , instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition . Also if you have to do in history you can go on the computer and find on him / her .

8720,814,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , I do not think that computers are something that people should be using @ NUM1 . Computers have something to them where somehow the become addictive . From the people who are gaining weight every day because the sit on the computer and chat all day . Then there are those terrible people on the internet who disguise themselfs so they look like a @ NUM2 year old boy when there really a year old man . Lastly , people now a days are using the computer as a sorce of reading instead of books . I just think that computers are ruining the life of many people . For starters , most people today are becoming overweight because they either wacth to much @ CAPS2 , or they sit on the computer and eat all day . Once you start with the computer you will never stop . Especially if your multi - tasking where you eat and use the computer . The big problem is people think it is better to be sitting home than out enjoying nature exercising ! It really is not good that people do not get of the computer and start enjoying life . Next not everyone online is who they say they are who make false accounts on like @ CAPS3 or @ CAPS4 . There can be men who say there and really be @ NUM3 . With all the posting of pictures someone you with it . Just remember to be careful ! Lastly , people in todays day in age use the computer to read books instead of going to the library or @ CAPS5 and @ CAPS6 ( or any book store ) . I think that all those bookstores are going to run out of business because of the technology now a days . When I was younger and I said that I was going to read a book , I was really reading one . I was not reading it on the computer . People need to cut down on the electronics . In the end I think that computers are a real waste of time . There is no reason why people should be on the computer instead of exercise . Everyone needs to stay away from the bad people online . Also can we please start using normal books instead of online ones .

8723,1521,1,"I believe computers have a positive effect on people because computers can help people in many ways . You can e - mail friends from across the world , get important information you might need , and also you can do business online . Computers have fasinating things to show and inform .

It would mean a lot to your friends it you just take time to say hello through e - mail . My second opinion on why using computers are a positive effect on people because . Some middle school through college & the rest of you life need to use computers . Maybe because of some important information they might need for an assignment from a teacher . Not all the time you can find certain things in books . Now a days computers are taking over books . My third opinion for computers is that some people are to I will to go to work so they work online . Even though you are I will you will still be getting paid because you are still working .

8724,193,1,"Dear @ PERSON1 weekly , The new millenium brought a new wave of technology . Computers is the main invention that most likely everyone uses . The computers teach us great things such as learning about a vacation spot or a far off country . The computer allows us to talk to friends or family while they are away or even home . Also , typing on the computer teaches us hand eye coordination that can help us with other things . The computer is surely a great invention . Have you ever wanted to go on vacation to somewhere overseas ? we will the computer is a great source for learning about these places . The effects it has could be significant . One day some one might want to go to the bahamas , but then finds a new location such as @ LOCATION1 or even @ LOCATION3 . In addition the computer benefits students very we will . Students usually have to do projects on places in the world and the computer is the main source of intelligence . When I have an essay to do I always use the computer first . Recently my grandmother moved down to @ LOCATION2 and I can only talk to her on the phone . Although on my computer I can actually see her on my screen . The webcam allows me to see me grandma . The computer allows you to keep in touch with friends and family that you do not see on a regular bases . For example @ CAPS1 or twitter keeps you in touch with friends from high school . The computer can also send emails to friends and family so you can say hello every once in a while . Sports require a great deal of hand eye coordination . The computer makes you better at this . By looking at the screen while typing , gives you a boost on your hand - eye coordination because you are doing two things at once . A sport that requires a lot of this is @ CAPS2 . While the ball is in the air you must focus on it while holding your stick at the correct position . Although hand - eye coordination is mainly taught through the powers of the computer . To conclude , all that I would like to say is that the computer is a great source for intellegence . It also allows you to keep in touch with high school friends and far away family .

8725,183,1,"Dear local newspaper , I overheard some people talking about how much time their families spend on the computer . My opinion is that they should not be on the computer staring at a screen for long periods of time . I think this because it takes away time from important tasks , there is something healthier than enclosing yourself with a computer monitor , that would be going outside or being active . Another reason is that you can have more time being around family and friends . First , you should not be spending so much time on the computer . You could be getting other tasks done . Such @ CAPS2 working , or for most teens , doing homework . Studies show that @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 teens get easily distracted by social networking websites such @ CAPS2 "" @ CAPS1 "" . "" twitter "" , and "" aol "" . People in the workplace are distracted two . Sometimes the job can get boring , so workers just go on the computer instead of getting things done . Children could be doing chores or just helping around the house a little , but they go on the computer instead . Teens regular routine consists of waking up , getting ready , soing on the computer , school , coming home , snack , and then going back to the computer . We need to break those habits of going back to the computer . Staring at a computer screen for long periods of time is not healthy . Instead , you could be active in a sport , or just going outside and playing . "" @ CAPS2 technology goes up seizure rates have also gone up . "" @ CAPS3 to a doctor at @ ORGANIZATION1 . Being involved in a sport would be healthier and more fun that talking to people online . Also , your not exercising while on the computer , being active keeps your shape along with being fun . The most important reason you should not be on the computer for a long time is because your using valuable time you could have used to spend with family and friends . Most people barely see their family when their at home because their consumed in the computer . Laptops have made it easier to block people out . Bringing it into your room and shutting the door , is the most common way . Hang out with the friends your already talking to online , would not it be better in person ?

My first reason why people should not spend so much time on the computer is that it is bad for their health . Spending to much time on their computers can strain your eyes . Some people with seizures including myself would trigier an attack and cause us to space out . Spending to much time on the computer can mess up your vision or damage your body .

You realize that exploring nature is better than just watching it . Those are my reasons why spending to much time on the computer is bad . it is not health .

With a computer if a student forgot his or her homework they could most likley use a computer to find out what the work was .

8731,1634,1,"Dear Local Newspaper @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 is great concern about computers and wether or not people spend to much time sitting infront of the screen or not . I believe that people should be more aware of the time they are in the computers . Instead of ruining your eyes you should be exercising , enjoying , and being with family and friends . Exercising is a major part of every persons life and if you do not get enough of it you could become obeise . Obeisity @ MONTH1 cause people to not like you or think that you are a slob . Although you might say that you do not care what others think , but in the long run it might be a mistake if you think this way . exercise will most likely rid you of almost any type of discrimination because you will look no different or even better than the average person . If you ever get the chance get a telescope and set it up in a spot where you can see the stars at night . Instead of keeping your eyes glued to the computer on a nice , sunny joy , go for a walk in the woods . As you can see , nature is much more beautiful than hundreds of tiny tots of colors forming an image of nature . If you find an image of a beautiful plant , why not go and see or feel the plant ' in person ? Many programs are now available on computers that let you see people , but would not you rather talk to him or her in real life ? I sure would and I think most other people would as we will . @ PERCENT1 of the population of @ LOCATION1 said that they would much rather talk to friends or relatives in person than on a computer screen . I feel that however possible , you should always talk to people in person and not through cameras and wires . I hope I have made myself clear that exercising , nature , and people in real life are all much better options than being in front of a computer for the rest of your life .",8.0,169,3.96106131084302,21.6875,16,0.485632183908046,5.0,1.5316091954022988,0.8112781244591328,0.02298850574712644,16.0

This could help you learn about other cultures , places , or something as simple as what is @ LOCATION1 creampie . the computer has endless knowledge . This is a huge benifit because a computer is one of the few tools that could help you expand your learning with a click of a button . Having a computer also allows you to talk to family and friends .

One of my favorite things to do is talk and when on of my best friends moved away and I lost his phone number I thought we had no way of doing it . One day he requested me on facebook and from there on we have been comunicating on web sites like facebook , myspace and , skype . My second reason why computer ' s benifit our society is @ CAPS2 . At my dad ' s house I do not have a television so I rely on the internet to keep me informed on what is going on in the world . A website called @ CAPS4 . com was the frist to anounce @ PERSON1 ' s death befor anyone even suspected it . Stories like that often break rest on the internet . The third reason why computers benefit our society is entertainment . You can watch videos , play games , listen to music , comunicate with friends . The last reason why computers benefit our society is @ CAPS3 . Many @ CAPS3 in our comunity require computer skills such as a acountant , a manager , software designner , and a computer programer .

It can give you all the information you need with just a click of a button , entertainment is easy to find by searching the internet , and most importantly , it improves communication between people . One way computers benefit society is , by making it easier for everyone to get information about something . This is needed , especially in school . It can help kids get their information about the person they are writing about in their report . Getting information easily on the internet can also help people in other ways . What if someone needed to get the hospital ' s phone number in case of an emergency ? He can use the computer to help him find that phone number . Another way computers benefit society is by allowing us to get any form of entertainment easily . This is what majority of the people in our society rely on . Alot of people use the computer to play games , listen to music , and watch online videos . If someone was bored right now , he or she could use the computer to play fun games . What if that person thought it was a little quiet in his or her room ? He or she could then use the computer to listen to music . Without computers we would probably be really bored for the rest of our lives . Finally , and most importantly , computers help improve communication between people . This is probably what everyone uses the computer for . Now you can send electronic mail to your friends in just seconds , post and view pictures of your family or relatives and you can even use an instant messanger to write to your friend and get messages from your friend in the fastest speed possible ! Without computers , communication between others would be very hard .

8735,666,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ ORGANIZATION2 , I believe that computers have a positive affect on people who use them . Because they teach hand eye coordination , give us the ability to learn about far away people and places and allow us to chat online with people . @ CAPS3 first reason of why I think computers have a positive affect on people is that they teach hand eye coordination . For example , we need to use our hand - eye coordination skills when we type to @ CAPS2 the letters . This helps us increase our Hand eye coordination because it helps us think about what letters we are typing , @ CAPS2 the letters on the keyboard , and push them . Also when we type long passages it increase our hand eye coordination becaue we get used to wrighting the long paragraphs and we become more familiar with where the letters are on the keyboard and our speed increases , which means we can get more work done in a shorter time . Believe it or not @ PERSON1 free of the @ ORGANIZATION1 hospital took a survey that showed @ NUM1 people who type essays instead of wrighting them by hand , have a greater hand eye coordination skill . Computers also allow us to learn about far away people and places . For example computers make it easier to reaserch far away people and places . Useing a computer can help us understand and learn about people and places withought a trip to the library . Also computers allow us to @ CAPS2 us to @ CAPS2 more info about recent events that have just around the world . Also computers make it faster to reserch topics because looking for a book in those big libraries can be stressfull , not to mention dificult . Also informat on a computer can never be checked out or not availible like library books . Lastly you have information right at our fingerries so you will never have to leave you are house , @ CAPS3 last reason is that computers allwo us to chat online with other people . This can help us because it allows us to talk to friends and family from around the world . Also it helps us talk to our parents if they are away or if you are on a camping trip . Chating on a computer is a great way to make friends with people you do not know and block people you do not want talking to you .

I do not think you would want to have to pay money to get anti software that probubly does not work . Anothe reason why I think that gaining using computer is good because what if you want become a computer enginere , all that time you have spent on the computer could really benifit you later on in life . Secondly I think that computers could help you meet new people from foreign countries and other states . Not you have to meet them in person you could just have a friendly consversation online .

I personally think computers have a positive effect on people because with computers many people @ CAPS1 research about the past . Also I do not agree that computers have a negative effect on anybody because with computers many people learn hand - eye coordinations , gives them the ability to learn about faraway people and places , they also allow people to talk to old friends or family members . Then , computers can also be used to help someone find information about nature such as different trees , plants , animals , and many other things that are involved in nature . After that , computers are also sometimes used to contact people who live faraway from you . Some ways to contact people on a computer are using e - mails , instant message , facebook , myspace , and many other websites . In addition , I think computers have a positive effect on people , but others maya not agree which is fine because not everybody has the same opinion on stuff in the world . Then , computers can be very useful to many people because they can use computers if they need to find information on history , any events that might have went on in the past that might not still be done in the present . Finally , computers are useful to scientists , business workers , many adults , and even children use computers if they need to type something for school or need to find information for a project they are doing .",8.0,126,3.0682885857626814,27.66666666666667,9,0.504,6.0,1.788,0.7642045065086203,0.004,9.0

I agree with the effects computer haves on people , because one it allows us to access information , two it allows us to interact with people .

My first reason why we should use computers is because it gives us information , like the weather reports , school openings , delays , and closings . It also tell ' s us how @ LOCATION1 has been after the earthquake . It tells us alot of stuff . It allow ' s to go to other websites to find information to . And it allow ' s us to have fun and play games on the internet . It can help us on our homework . And it can help us find things like job and other stuff . My second reason why we should use computers is because we can ineract with people . We can talk to people we have never ever met before . We can find information about them and tell us how is their life litte . it can help police find info about their criminals and track them down so they can them . It is better and faster than using the phone to talk to them . And it can make people have fun which will make them stay on the computer for a long period of time . My third reason why we should use computers is because it would keep us updated on and for these who love to watch it would tell us the most recent on teams and players . And if you a sports fanatic you can be able to watch live games on the computer . And we can be able to post games and have a chance to see the players talk to their fans .

Teenagers just can not wait to chat with their friends on facebook and instant message . There are a lot of positive and negative things about computers . In these paragraphs below I am going to give you my opinion , tell you how people can manage there time better and the effects it can have . My @ CAPS1 experience with computers is that they have @ CAPS3 much information but sometimes it can be too much . Today , a lot of children and teenagers are getting bullied . People can send horrible messages to someone . They rather do it on the computer because they do not have to say it to there faces . that is one thing that I do not live about computers is that people can get harrased . Other then that I think the computer is a great resource for learning about things and also connecting with people from your past . Not a lot of @ CAPS2 want to see there child coming straight home from school and go right to the computer @ CAPS2 have to be strict with there child when it comes to computers . They need to manage there time @ CAPS3 they can alson do there homework , after school activities etc . Studies have shown that children who go on the computer every single day for more than two hours are most timely to see their grades drop . that is why if you mange your time it would not be a problem . You want your child to have a balance in there life , @ CAPS3 manage the time where they are not all day long . There are positive things about the computer and as we will as negative things . The computer is a great way to research people you are learning about in school and find people from your past for example , facebook is a great way to stay connected to your old buddies . Google is also a great tool because you can type in anything and it wil give you a hundred websites to chose from a negative effect about it is that people are likely to say things on it to other people that they would not dare to beg to there face . It also prevents you from doing other things because you get @ CAPS3 consumed about the computer you forget your main priorietees . In these paragraphs I gave you my opion on computers and how there are posotive and negative things about them . I also explainted how it can taking up your time with your main priorities in life and how to manage your time wisely .

First of all you know that the world is becoming obease because of lack of exercise . Also people do not realize that @ CAPS3 warming is becomeing a big problum . Finally familys arn ' t as close as they used to be . these are all the reasons why computers arn ' t important to human socioty . First of the world is becomeing obease and cumputers play a huge part in this . Computers do not make people exercise they basicly just sit down on there couch and use the computer this will not help amarica get back into shape . Also computers become a habbit if a person uses a computer everyday of there life it will become an addiction then they will not be able to stop . Finally when people use the computer they do not realize the lack exersise there getting . This is the first reason why computeres are a bad thing . Next @ CAPS3 warming is mealting the polar ice caps . Computers play a part in @ CAPS3 warming because they use electricty and thjen the electrisity melts the polar ice caps . If this keeps happining then they will all melt and we will not have a shorline and half of the world will be fluded . Finally computers play a huge part in @ CAPS3 warming because of the fact that they are so popular . This is another reason why computers are bad . Finally the last reason why computers are bad is because they take away from your family life . For instance there are more and more familys splitting up now and sientest sat that @ PERCENT1 of the time it is because of technolagy . When on peroson is on the computer the other people feel that they love the computer more than they love themselfs . Then they split up for good . This is the last reason why I feel computers are bad . In conclution you can see that computeres are a bad thing . First of all you can see that amarica is becomeing obease because of the computers . Also computers are causeing @ CAPS3 warming and are eventually goung to flood the earth . And last but not least computers take away from peoples family life and cause them to split up and become unhappy .

Now a days instead of bitting the gym many people are home on the computer talking to friends or playing computer games .

If people were to go and start doing things besides the computer they will live a happier , healthier , and better life . Unfortunatly , many young people are not getting in to play sports . During this decade many sports games have come out for the computer . Now instead of pushing themselves to work hard for aspact , kids ethier play with no heart or do not play at all .

My first reason has to do with the knowledge that the computer possesses . You can practically discover anything in the blink of an eye , as opossed to a book or going to the library ; which is very time consuming Not only does a computer take for less time to get information , it also holds a much large amount of information than a library can store . Computers hold knowledge on almost everything imaginable , but best of all , it is right your fingertips .

There should be @ ORGANIZATION1 for both being on the computer and for excersise and fun with friends this problem has most likely influenced many to com to dislike the computer , but you must understand that the time children spend on the computer is entirely up to him / her or the parents .

When you are on your walk you @ CAPS2 find interesting new species . Also when you are outside you can play with your friends or siblings . @ CAPS2 times in neighborhoods there are a lot of kids , you can start a pick of game of baseball .

It will cool you down without having to pay money for an air conditioner . You @ MONTH1 also find the oportunety to go to a different state for the day .

Going places with your family and friends can pad to a worth wild experinse . @ PERCENT1 of kids chose to go on the computer than to exercise . Kids will become overweight . When on the computer @ CAPS2 kids will eat . Eating for hours each day to not a good idea . You can go out for your schools basketball team or run distances in cross country . Once you are on the team you will make new friends , and get your exercise for the day . When you are on a team and exercising you will learn @ CAPS2 life skills .

For istance , they spend so much time on computer they have lose time to exerise , enjoy natue , and interact with friends and family . Computers have a negative effect on people . Many people do not excerise for only @ NUM2 min . But when you are distracted on your computer aming or facebooking you forget to excrise or just go it for @ NUM3 min . Because you want to get back to the computer . Computers on your desk starring at you and you sampled to go on . While , the yoga mat or weights sit on ground sterring at you too . However , the computers is mak fun and less woris . Therefore , your more willing to go on computer then excrise . Computers make it hand to excrise because your less into thinking how to this right and take you the because your thinking about a computer game , you played facebook , email and bunch more things on computer . So computers are unhealthy for people to have . Nature is beatiful , how the trees sway in the and butterflies fly in the air then there are all type of seasons with beatiful senery and . However there re stuffy room with sholves a desk and some picture that is the serey the people got when @ MONTH1 are on the computer all the time .

People comuter are not walking on beach on taking a nice long hike in woods dad not taking a stroll in a ark these are missing out on getting some fresh air and seeing the senery nature has to offer us . Instead they are sitting chair starring at a computer screen . However , pretty could that be compared to enjoying nature beatity ? Computers are testing away people enjoying nature . Hanging - out with friends are family is a fun thing to @ CAPS1 but how are you suppose to long out with them if your to the computer ? They are not going to internet with their friends or family .

I believe computers do have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online , learn about new things , and gives you hand eye coordination . My first reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online . Some people do not have phones but do have computers . If you needed to contact somebody you could do it using a computer . Also some people have family and friends who live across the world . Computers are great for keeping in touch , it also will not cost you a lot for long distance , like phones would . Because computers give you the ability to talk to friends , family , and other people it is a positive thing because it is important to do so . My second reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ablity to learn about new things . Learning about new things using a computer gives a positive effect on people because you do not have to travel and go places to get information to learn about things . You could do by a click of a button . People could use the computer to learn about anything or everything . Being able to not have to leave your home to gather information about new things gives a positive effect on people because now more people will be able to learn more because they have more time than they would traveling places to get information . This is a positive effect on people because the more you know the better . Having a lot of knowlage is a good thing and will do good things for you in the future . My third reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches people hand and eye coordination . Having hand and eye coordination gives a positive effect on people because your going to need it through out live . If you do not have good hand and eye coordination , it is a bad thing because you use it for just about every thing , such as driving , writing , and excercizing . Computers give you the ablity to learn eye and hand coordontion throughout life which is why it is a posite thing for people .

8781,454,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 , To start off I would like to give my opinion on using compuers too much . Although I use a computer a lot I still have fun with friends and play sports . But to much time on the computer can cause you noth wanting to get exercise or maybe getting sick easier . Spending so much time on the computer can cause a kid to be shy in the outside life . Exerasing is very healthy for kids and adulst . there are way to many people on computers doing anything you can think of for hours . Staring at a computer screen for a long amount of time will not keep you fit or in shape . People should have a minimal amount of time of @ NUM1 minutes each day and then get some exercise . this way you would get time for being on the internet and still doing what is good for you , I should not feel bad about the people who waste all their time on the computer but I do . To see them getting gross and gaining weight from lack of exercise makes we want to help htem @ CAPS4 one should put themselves into that kind of situation . What I had noticed about people who stay online a lot is that they get sick more often . From sitting there like lazy bums they do not get fresh - air . Not getting enough fresh - air can cause a cold or for some people with problems to get very sick . They need to think twice about what they are getting themselves into . I would rather be having fun and getting nice fresh - air then sitting on the computer about to be sick . It can be a different story if you went home sick from work / school and went on the computer . but being sick from the computer is gross . Even though to say , people who are on the computer often are shy in person . If someone gets in a fight on the internet that can cause them so much pain to not even talk . Interacting with people is very nice and touching . But being shy and lonely because of a fight on the computer or from being on it too much , is something to be ashamed of you should not have to be that way because of one thing . Get out in the world and do not let things like that get to you . To this off , it would be nice for people to take care of themselves and not stay on the internet for so long . Remind yourself to have atleast @ NUM1 minutes to yourself and to do waht you want but get some exercise also . do not forget about staying healthy and going for a jog once in a while . You should not focus your life on your computer . Thank you and have a great day .",8.0,200,4.632391456375085,17.666666666666668,27,0.41841004184100417,5.0,1.4309623430962344,1.3992075416402177,0.02092050209205021,27.0

So @ CAPS1 first reason why I think spending to much time on computers is not a good thing because it is better to be outside doing other activities with other people all day instead you could hang out with friends and do some sports or something else and if your on the computer all day you will start to lose some friends . @ CAPS1 second reason why I do not think it is good to be on the computer all day is because if your not exercising you will start to gain weight cause your sitting all day just on the computer so it is good to go outside and go for a walk or you could go to a gym so you could do exercise is good for you it will keep you healthy cause I know someone who is on the computer all day and he really does not go outside because he says that computers teach you alot and they do but it is not good to be on it all day . @ CAPS1 last reason on some bad effects of computers is that some people could use these computers for bad things they could be going on some bad websites and that will just make you to be on the compute even longer you could even become addicted to being on computers because your doing nothing else ans some people have cameras on their computers and some people use them for same bad things so that is why it is better not to be on a computera ll day long .

For example , they could need information for a country like @ LOCATION2 , @ LOCATION3 , @ LOCATION1 . There are many way you can get this information . So if you did not have a computer where could you get all this information . If you get it from a it might not have what you are looking for your project .

There are many ways you can do this On @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 , twitter , yahoo . You could always because it is always better to make new friends . Even better to a family member .

Secondly computers make time enjoying nature . Finally interacting with family and friends is important when on the computer you do not do much of that . Plese read on to find out what i have to say about computers . Using a computer has a of down falls but @ CAPS1 of which is the lack of exerizing while on the computer . As you @ MONTH1 know that many countrys are becoming obese because the lack of exersize . Computers are no help to this problem . The only exersize computer contribute is the hand and fingers but even that is bad because if you are typing and on computer for too long you will get carpeltunlye in the fingers and hands . @ PERSON1 , an expert on health , said "" @ CAPS1 in three people go on the computer for more than @ CAPS1 hour a day , which could lead to obesinty .

This will be used through out people lives . WIthout hand - eye coordination people will be clumsey . Hand - eye coordination is used from day to day everyday . Using a computer you have to look at the screen and type at the same time . For people who do not have good hand - eye coordiantion this will be a big help . They will be able to do more thing without messing up . Like hitting a baseball ! For kids who want to play sports this could acually help . They will learn to use there eyes , arms , and hands to there advantage . Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places . If we did not have this ability we will not be able to know what is going on around the world . Also if you have family in a faraway place you will be able to look online and see what is happening there . If something bad has happened you will know this and will be able to help them . Also to be able to learn about faraway places will help in school . If you have a report to do on of faraway place instead of looking through you can look on the internet for information . Computers also allow people to talk online with other people . This gives more comunication . You will be able to make more friends and better friends . To have the opportuniy to talk to people online is great . You can learn about someone and become friends and hang out a lot . Also you will become a lot more interactive with people . If you are a shy person this can help you . You will get used to talking to people and when you get comfortable you will talk to them in real life . This will make you a lot more friends .

They are also concerned that looking at the screen could be damaging to your eyes . Those statements maybe true . I believe that computers are beneficial . You can talk to people from other places . You could learn about other places in the world . You can also use the computer to research topics . first off , on the computer you can talk to people . Whether it on a webcam or one of those networks to @ LOCATION1 and chat with each other . On the computer you can chat and talk with people without having to be on the phone and paying a bill for it . For example , I have family in another country and one way we always talk is on the computer . We talk on webcam and chat . Calling someone from another country on the phone gets really expensive . If I did not have a computer then I would not have that great of contact with @ CAPS2 family from another country . In addition , You can use the computer to look at foreign countries . Many people including @ CAPS2 parents have used the computer to look and read into about other countries . @ CAPS2 mother , whenever @ CAPS1 plans a vacation , looks up the country we are going to and gets more information about it . Like @ DATE1 we went to a hot exotic place , @ CAPS2 mom looked it up to see what we should pack to go there . If it weren ' t for the computer we might have packed the wrong items . Lastly , computers are a great source for researching . I can not tell you how many times I have used the computer to research . Books and encyclopedias are great sources but the computer has so much to offer . You have so many links you can go to and sites . You can find pictures , videos , maps , and much more . I have used the computer many times to research , sometimes it is a requirement to have a few sites you have gone on to research for your project in school or something . If you have a computer at home you can build up your computer skills for school . Computers are a more positive thing than negative . You can talk to people without the expensive phone bill . You can learn about other places and cultures . Also , you can use it for researching purposes .

8792,1430,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , @ CAPS1 you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people ? In my opinion , I would say that computers have negative effects on us . This is because we would get less exercise , less time to enjoy nature , and interacting with family and friends . If your on the computer most of the time at home , how would you get your exercise ? You would not because the whole time you would be stuck sitting down at the desktop . This is also a proble because this is how obeseity can occur from no exercies , and just sitting all day . Or people who have heart problems nad need exercise can worsen by being distracted by the computer . Being home on the computer does not let you enjoy nature . Instead of going outside in the warm wheather , having fun people are staying home . This is not good because they should be out having fun , not on the computer all day . Missing time with family and frinds is unexeptable when your on the computer . This is because yar supposed to keep your family and friends company and not daze off on what your doing on the computer . Also you miss family gatherings or leave yar friends lonley . that is because yar to busy on the camourar nad not paying attention to anyone arand you . This is why I think computers have a negative effect on people .

8793,581,1,"Are computers benefiting society ? I believe that computers are actually not benifiting society . In this article I will explain how you will recieve less time exersising , less time with your family and friends , and less time enjoying nature just by being on you computers to much . If you are one of those people that love to be on the computer as much as you can ? we will , think of it this way . You spend so much time on the computer that you recieve little or no exercise ! Everyone needs to recieve a little bit of exercise in order to fit and healthy . Our country ' s obesity level has gone up since our high - tech computers have come out . I believe that this is one main reasons of obesity . This is a major concern in our high - tech , computer society today . Besides you recieving less exercise , you will also recieve less time with your family and friends . I understand with your family could talk to them on facebook but you need interaction by talking face to face . This is one of our basic needs as an individual . Your family is going to be by your side no matter what . But you need to build a strong relationship with your family in order for them to be there for you . This is only going to happen if you interact face to face with them . The same thing goes for friends . This is another nacessity for basic needs ! Everyone should have some relationship . Lastly , everyone needs to enjoy nature ! It is a beautiful sight that everyone needs to expirence . Being trapped inside the house to be on your computer is a terrible thing to do . The beauties of nature are amanding everybody but @ NUM1 of people do not take the opportunity to enjoy it . Being outside and enjoying yourself is a big thing for your body to survive . You need to sook up the powerful rays of the sun and have a life changing look around nature . But @ CAPS1 of this will happen if you stay on your computer @ NUM2 . In conclusion , computers are not benifiting society . People recieve little or no exercise , interaction with friends of family , and a chance to enjoy nature . Everyone nedds to have these needs instead of fucusing all on the computer .",8.0,169,4.713100869516441,13.241379310344827,29,0.4389610389610389,6.0,1.7064935064935065,1.4819007246815639,0.03116883116883117,29.0

My first reason why computers have bad effects on people who use computers , is the health issue . Health in very important but sitting in front of a computer for hours makes matters worst . By the way you hunch your back in order to see something small on the computer creen , or when you hold on the mouse , waiting to click onm something for long period of time , can cause arthrities . My second reason why computers have bad effects on people who use them . Are that people who are on computers & end to sometimes refuse to spend time with family or friends like for example : @ CAPS1 say a week ago you made a promise to have a family get together with the family , and they all count on you to come , @ CAPS2 you get a computers , you go on all these neat websites that you never heard off it is amazing right ! WRONG ! before you know if , it is the day for the family get together and your line an hour @ CAPS4 you amke excuse not to come . And that breaks you family ' s heat . My last reason why , to me computers are a bad idea is you can learn about another the computer by going on to a But it is ore fun traveling or meeting people from that place @ CAPS2 setting in a for and having your neck , back and sore @ CAPS3 I right , I think I @ CAPS3 . Also idsfun to and ear foods from the culture that you fing cool off that lame computers . ( To me that sounds like a good time to invite family and friends ! ) @ CAPS4 therefore in conclusion , in my personal opinion computers have bad effects of people health , it can cause later bacj and neck problems maybe even activities . People who use computers a lot or love to spend time on computers refuse to spend time with family and friends , and @ NUM3 You can find more about something like a culture or land , if you go and study it is yourself instead of going on a computers for hours .

8796,403,1,"Dear Local @ CAPS1 , I think that computers have a posotive effect on people . There is many ways computers can have posotive effects on humans , first computers bring people together and let people interact with each other , They let people talk to each other . Computers also let people learn about new things . The internet has so much information . Computers also let people do things that they can not do with out computers . So computers have a positive effect on people . Computers let people interact with each other . The computers bring people together . People can use the internet to send emails to each other . When you need to write a letter to some one it might take days for them to got it . But with email they would get it the second you send it . There is also website like face book that let you talk to your friends websites like that connect people . When you and you freind can not talk together you just have to get on you computer . Computers also have web camera , those let people talk to echother . and you can see them . It lets people see the other persons facial expressions and hear the there voice which is better than on a phone and writing a letter to someone that is why computers are a positive effect on people Computers also let you learn about new things when ever you want to find somthing out or if you have a question you go to the internet . If you someone else they might not know the answer . Computer let people see pictures and videos . If you wanted to see a picture of @ CAPS2 are that you are going into a computer and type it in computers let people see pictures that they could not see in real life . Vidios let you watch things like something funny to cheer up you day . If you love a show on to , and you missed it you can find it on computer . That is why computer benifit people positively . Computers also let you do things that you could not do without . When a teacher asks me to type a paper I always do it on the computer . If there were no computers I would have to use a typewriter and if I made a mistake I would have to type the whole thing again . Computers also alow you to play music . On the computer you can put a cd in and it will play the music . Computers alow you to do things that could not do without Computers benifit society an have a positive effect on people , They let people interact with each other and they bring people together . They let people talk to each other . Computers also let you learn about newthings . They also let you do things that you could not do without .

First , it teaches good hand - eye coordination . Second , it lets people communicate with other people . Third , it can help with school and work . As you can see this is why I believe it is positive . First , computers teach good hand - eye coordination . While you use computers you are improving your hand - eye coordination . One way is that when you are online and you see something you like or want to see even bigger , you move the mouse and click . This helps because you saw something and did not need to see where you were moving the mouse to click on it . Also it helps because when you are typing a paper you do not need to look at the keys to know what to type . You can look at the screen and move your fingers freely . As you can see this is my first reason as to why I believe computers are positive . Second , computers help people communicate with others . This can be important if you need to talk to someone that lives far away . If someone lives to far away and their is something important then the @ CAPS7 is great . You can send people @ CAPS3 or even @ CAPS4 chat someone . It helps communication so much that you have choices on how you want to talk to someone . Third , it helps people with school and sometimes work . It helps people because they could @ CAPS2 projects . This can be helpful to learn about places you did not even know existed . One time I was wondering what people from @ LOCATION1 did to live and survive . Being @ CAPS5 , I just had to know . I went on the computer and in about a half hour I knew exactly what and how @ CAPS5 people did to live and survive . This could also help at work because it your boss is counting on you to have work done , you can use the @ CAPS7 . As you can see this is my third and final reason as to why I believe computers are positive . In conclusion , I believe that computers are positive for three main reasons . First , they can help to improve hand - eye coordination . Second , they help people communicate with people from other areas . Third , it helps with school and work . So now that you have read this I hope I have shown you that computers are not bad for us at all .

8801,1180,1,"Dear local newspaper , @ CAPS1 ! Get off that computer it is @ TIME1 . But mom I do not want to I am in the middle of a game . Does that conbersation sound familiar ? Of course it does . Every kid likes to play on the computer . However , noticing your kid being on the computer @ NUM1 is not a good thing . In this matter experts are definatley @ PERCENT1 right because kids and adults are spending too much time on the computer . These people can do other things like excersising more , enjoying nature , and interacting with friends and family . Spending too much time on the computer is not healthy . On the other hand , if someone kicks you of the computer you can always get that six pack you wanted . There are three main things that can get you in shape . First , taking a light run every night on your community track can get your legs from being fatigued every time you walk up the stairs to having your legs be firm and able to run lap after lap just for a warm up . Every years my dad takes me to the track in @ DATE1 and times me for @ NUM2 and @ NUM3 yard dash , the @ NUM4 meter , and the mile . Between the months I train all the way up to @ DATE2 then my dad does another assment . I do this training because I play baseball . Weight lifting is another way to get in shape . Some basic excersises are bench pressing , squating , and dumbell curles . There are more challenging excersise but I will not go into that . Once you feel like your in shape , take all of that trainign and put it into a sport . Excersising is not the only thing you can do . Enjoying nature is another option . Just go outside if someone kicks you off your computer . Absoarb everything about the nature . From the squirrls to the tress . If you are in the winter enjoy the snow instedid of being inside @ NUM1 playing computer games . But , if that does not work out for you then hangout with your family . Hanging out with your family can be thing you can do . Gather your family and plan a trip . You can go to a baseball game , park , or movies anything that will get you away from that computer .

8802,1032,1,"Computers and other devices are good for humans especially young people like myself because they are good for communication , keeping the attention of the and providing unknown information . In @ CAPS3 letter , I will explain . Communication is key , and technology is close the best and fastest way to use communiocation . Cell phones provide calling usage of course , but they also allow you to text someone . If you have dinner with friends and your late , with text you can send them a message and they should get it in no time at all . Email allows you to do the same as text , but you can write longer messages . Something that is really good for communicating is video chat . If you have a relative that you have not seen in a long time you can video chat and they can see you and you can see them . it is like talking to one another in person . Keeping a persons attention is critical . Technology does that with games , music from @ NUM1 ' s , computers , game systems and the newest way , iPod ' s and instructions on how to do something . Of course a teacher or parents can do that , but heaving or seeing instructions on a computer is so much more exciting , which brings me back to @ CAPS3 topic of keeping a persons attention . Technological devices are more exciting than people teachers and definitely parents but do they offer more ? Information is most likiely the most frequent reason in which technology is used . If a child has a project for school , they either use the computers or asks their parents . If the parents have no idea about the question their child just asked , they say , "" @ CAPS1 it up on the computer "" , if you have not already done that . So in a way the human race depends on technology , actually we do depend on technology . Computers cellphones , iPods , gamesystems , etc all include a little thing I ' d like to call the internet . The internet has been around for a while , going from extremely slow to high - speed , and it is a magical place . It can provide you with directions , recipes , job offers , store locations show times for movies and much , much more . Although technology is used in everyday life from communication to searching for information it can slowly us the human race down . I mean most of us spend most of our time on @ CAPS2 or @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 when we should be walking around are exercising , looking at the trees and the birds and communicating with family face ti face .

8803,1529,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , I rencently started researching the effects that computers have on people an have found some shocking facts . I do not belive computers benefit society at all . Three reasons why I believe this is because it makes people lack exercising , enjoying nature , and interacting with friends @ CAPS1 is a rising problem in @ LOCATION1 and a major factor towards @ CAPS1 is computers . In fact statics so that people who spend more time exercising than looking at electronics all day actully live longer lives . So my first reason about why computers do not benfit society is that it lets people lack exercise . People need exercise to live and with computers it is becoming more lacking than ever . Also , exercise give you interfines a not more that makes you happy if you live your life exercising instead of watching or doing violant things on the web that will lead to a less violant future . My second reason is that computers cause a lack of enjoying nature . Nature is a beautiful thing filled with simmering lakes , the beautiful scent of balsam fine , and thosands of creatures . With computers thoshands of kids are missing out on the fresh air and adventures that nature has in store . My parents did not have computers when they were little and they say that they enjoyed running around their neighborhoods playing sports and other fun activities . Finally , computers lack in interacting with friends . Remember when you were little and you called up your friend to hang out and sleepover , we will now computers have caused people not to have to call or hang out with friends . Instead you can just @ CAPS2 or email them and @ CAPS3 you can have a conversation without even looking at a person !

There are three reasons why you should agree with me and these reasons are people have the right to choose what they want to , in this weather it is a little bit to cold to go out and enjoy nature , lastly they can interact with friends and familys online on a website . People have the right to choose what they do because the goverment can not choose for you since they are busy with other more important stuff . Also in the constitution it states that the goverment can not choose for us while we have the power to think . In this weather it is cold to go out , plus nature is so much better in the @ DATE1 and the @ DATE2 where it is not to hot to cold and that is when the sun is good that is when people should enjoy nature .

Eye protection is important . Although computers are hurting them by , the screen being too bright and hurting your eyes . Also if you look for too long it could make them tierd . I can tell you from personal experence that glasses are un - cool and some people get picked on for it and that could happen if your eyes get hurt so you can see as we will as you did befor . it is glasses or even going blind .

Sexual harrasment if extreamly can make people feel usually bad selfs . Kids take pride in calling others bad names regarding there rase , there gender , or even the gender they like . So take extra percaution when seeing sexual harrasment . Sexual preditors are a parents biggest fear to kids . Sexual preditors are everyware , @ CAPS4 , @ CAPS5 , @ CAPS3 , or even your neibors and wile kids are running around town looking and acting the way they do there extreamly un - safe . This is why you @ CAPS7 put any personal information on the @ CAPS2 not your adress , not your birthday , not your cell or house numbers , nothing not even your town .

I say this because it is true people get on the computer for a long time and forget about their family , there is also all kinds of danger online , and lastly your brain is not getting enough work out . do not you think all of this is true ? we will , then if you still do not believe me I will prove it to you . First , people get addicted to the computer they forget about there family . Insted of beign on the computer just looking for stuff like myspace or facebook , but they should spend time with their families playing games like @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 , or @ CAPS3 . I say this from a personal expirience , it was not me it was my cousin @ PERSON1 he got addicted to the computer so much that everytime his family tried to do something fun together they would always end up fighting because he did not want to go . Secondly , people can be facing major danger online , for example when you got to those chat sessions where you meet people supposley your age , but it might not always be that way everytime on the news you see stories where old people try act like @ NUM1 year olds , but they are not they just want to do bad stuff . So you can be facing a lot of dangerd online . Lastly , by beign on the computer your not letting your brain get the good workout or exersice it needs . Your just letting it be there , but instead you can be reading a book or do a word seach puzzle ; these are all good idea for making your brain exersice . On a recent research experts say that people spend time reading and exersicing their brains do very good on test , but people who spend most of the time in the computer fail test . So do not you think I am right ? do not you think that if you spend to much time on a computer you have less time with your family . You can be facing serious danger , and your brain is not getting the exercise it needs .

8808,865,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , I am writing a letter to you to explain why I think computers are not good to have . My three supporting reasons are that if you are on the computer all the time there ' s a chance that you might gain weight and becom obese . You would rather be on the computer than to hang out with your family , and lastly you will not have any friends to talk to . Please read on to hear my story . First of all if your always on the computer your not going to get up and go outside for a little because it will not be important to you . Also your going to have to eat and when you get exited your going to want to eat more . Then you will start getting overweight because you do not want to exercise . Secondly , you would spend less time with your family . You would think that your going to hang out with them later . So then you play more and get addicted . So then you and your family would grow apart . And you would be lonely because you gave up your family just so you can play a game on the computer . For my last reason on this matter is that you will not have friends . I think you will not have friends because if your on the computer all the time you will not even bother to go to the park to play or go to the gym , to try to get into sports then you will not meet anyone . The only friends that you would most likely have is friends on the computer . That you will never meet in real life and will not socialize to the about there life and to hang out with . In conclusion I think it is not a good idea to have a computer because you can become obese , you will spent less time with your family , and you will not have any friends to talk to . I hope you enjoyed this letter and take it into consideration .",8.0,137,3.9759029102129864,19.055555555555557,18,0.3982558139534884,5.0,1.4883720930232558,1.38210225325431,0.0029069767441860465,18.0
8809,1213,1,"In my opinion I agree that it benefits society . The reasons that support my decision are lots of buisnesses use computers to work , fast food resturants use computers , and schools use computers . Computers are all needed just for those reasons . My first reason is buisneses use computers to work . Workers use computers for designing , filing peoples names , and to type papers , and essays . People in the designing industry do not use paper and pencil anymore , because they use designing softwares to work . Instead of filing in a cabinet people and workers use computers to put their patients , clients , and workers . Computers can hold more information and files than cabinets can . People also type papers and essays for work . For example , news reporters have to write a report and type it for their company in order to get it to publish . If workers in buesness were to need to use computers to file , type , and design clothes and games . My second reason is that fast food resrurants or even resturants use computers , instead of using cash registers . For example @ ORGANIZATION2 or @ ORGANIZATION1 use technology to type in peoples orders , and amount they pay . Back then they used to use cash registers , in order to get money out they need to click a button , but now the have all locked up using computers . Every resturant has at least a touch screen computer in it to use . So resturants need computers to survive the world . My third reason is schools need computers for students and teachers to write reports , file the students name and grades into it . Students in classes write reports for projects or even for class work . Teachers need computers to file the students name , grades , and information , instead of using a cabinet . Teachers also use computers to make homework pages and they need to print stuff off of word . So schools use and need computers for students and teachers use . In conclusion I agree that computers benefit society , because buisnesses need them to work , design , and file , and fast food resturants so they can take peoples orders and to use in schools for students and teachers use . So that is why it benefits the society .",8.0,154,4.385666366742635,15.869565217391305,23,0.4207650273224044,7.0,1.6721311475409837,1.4910138707589942,0.01366120218579235,23.0

The reasons believe that is because the computer teaches us a lot of things , you can also find a relitive you have not seen in a long time . Two more reasons is because you could talk to your friends , another is you need it to put music on @ NUM1 ' s , @ CAPS1 ' s and other devices . My first reason I thought computers have a good effect on people was because it teaches us alot of things . If you wanted to know about a countries culture you will be able to go and find out on the computer . Without the computer you would have to visit not knowing what shot to take for sickness they have . Other things it could teach you is how to get from one place to another without stopping to ask people where a place is . it is important to know things on on the computer you can look it up and find out . Another is you can find a family member you have not seen in along time . Being able to reconnect with someone is very important . What if something happened to them and you did not know , like a broke leg or hip you can find out if you find them on the computer . Also alot of people @ MONTH1 have family they miss and want to be close to or talk to again they cannot find them and fill close to them again . And they can find you if they relly need to talk to you . You could also talk to your friends in a chat room with other friends or alone . If you have moved far away the computer is a good way to keep in touch with your old friends . Talking to a friends releaves some kids of their stress they had . It helps when your friends make you laugh and talk to you about leaving everything alone and breath . Everyone has one friend that talks them out of doing bad things . A friend like that is helpful . Last reason is you need a computer to put music on your @ NUM1 players . Music is very fun and alot of people love to listen to it . If you had no computers there would be no point in buying a lot of electronic devices because a lot you need the computer for . People like to listen to music on their @ CAPS1 or @ NUM1 while exercising but you need the computer to put music on it . Without computers theirs no point of music .

The issue to with is should more people sometime on their less time , exercising , enjoying nature , and interacting with family and friends should it be the other way around . The first reason why I think that people should spend more time exercising than on their computers is because I think that more to watch and watch the way they eat and keep that self fit because what responsible to see their kid eat and then out exercising and then then self . My second reason is I think that people should time enjoying nature then computer The reason I think this id because they would never would never know what going on computer .

My third reason is interacting with friends and family I think that people should friends and family then on the computer because interacting with friends and family you learn things that you never knew about then and you can places you never gonna be sure discover new things you never your life .

8818,840,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 , I agree that computers do have a positive effect on people . I agree , because being on the computer teaches you hand - eye coordination , helps people learn about faraway places and people , and allows people to talk to other people . By being on the computer it helps teach people hand - eye coordination . So the computer help with hand - eye coordination by using the mouse and keyboard . For example , when you use a computer you do not need to look at your hands while you use the mouse . That helps with hand - eye coordination , because you can see where your hand is without looking . Another example is the keyboard , because while learning where all the keys are you memorize them . Then soon you can type with without looking . The computer also helps you to learn . When you go on the computer the thing people go on is the internet . On the internet people can find information about faraway places or people . So , because the computer has different links and websites , it helps kids and adults everywhere to get information fast . Without the computer everyone would have to go to a library , but what if they did not have the right information ? Then you would need to trace around everywhere to find a book . that is why a computer is handy . Also , the computer allows people to stay in touch with others farther away . One example of this is that there are chat rooms or groups people can join . So , if a relative or friend is farther away from a more or if they are down the street , with chat rooms it makes talking easier . Also , by these chat rooms and groups it makes a lot of people happy knowing that they can still talk with an old friend or relative instead of loosing them from never seeing or talking to them . That is just another example why the computer has a positive effect . So , with the examples of the computer helping teach hand - eye coordination , makes obtaining information easier and of the many reasons and examples of the computer having a positive effect .",8.0,148,4.253026543479192,16.857142857142858,21,0.4169014084507042,6.0,1.6253521126760564,1.4180260055608096,0.00563380281690141,21.0

Even though some people say computers are sometimes used way too much , computers help the world get in touch with relatives and family from arand the world , job findings in different countries and states , and also learning about the whole world . I am going to explain to you why I think computers are positive for humans . To start off , I would like to say that not everyones families & friends live close by to each other . They @ MONTH1 live across the whole other side of the world . This is why we have webcams and chatting on computers . How could anyone expect us to see our family in friends if there is no webcam ? Okay yeah we have cell phones but not everyone can afford them . People can go to their hearest library and use the computer there for free ! The next reason why I say that computers are important is because when you get tired of fired from yar job , you can not just sit home and expect live in your house for free , you have @ CAPS1 find another job . You can sign up for jobs right on your computer . How much easier could it get ? Now you do not have to borrow your mom ' s car to go to the interview . Furthermore the last reason I would like to commit is that learning about the world is very important for the young and old . You do not think that every single teacher visited somewhere else and that is how they know about the world ? No of course not ! Teachers also use computers to look up information on a certain subject . For me I like to learn a bout crocodiles in @ LOCATION1 . I live in the @ ORGANIZATION2 . Do you really think I would go all the way of @ LOCATION1 to learn about crocodiles when I can just turn the computer on and get - lost in the crocodile world ? No of course not . It would be fun though to traver to @ LOCATION1 to see that but I do not have that kind of money . To sum all this up , I think you can see my part of the argument .

8824,75,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , In the past ten years , advances in technology have completely changed the world . Technology makes peoples lives much easier and helps keep more and more people connected throughout the world . More jobs are created and help speed up ordinary events such as taxes , messages , news , and teaching . However , many people have proven that too much use of technology can make teens and adults addicted to the internet . In this addiction many people can lose time with their family , time to exercise and enjoy nature . Since being part of the generation growing up in the new technology era , I have had a first hand experience with the benifits of the new technology . I believe that this technology is a great help to society today . Many more jobs are being created because of this technology . For example , think about how many people could be employed if a new computer system was created . There would be thousands of people working on many things such as the founder , manager , creater of new ideas or just working at the new companies retail store . Running a business or a corporation is a very difficult job to do . But because of the advances in technology , running a business can become much easier and not as much time is wasted . With the new technology , people can send emails within seconds instead of running around the entire office giving out memos . Also for businesses , their stocks of the company can be updated every minute . These advances will make easier to run and make them more efficent .

8828,1179,1,I believe that people spending to much time on computers can effect their health and the relationship they have with friends and family . If you are on the computer and one of your friends ask you to go outside you are most likely to say no because the computer is grabing your attention more than going outside . That hurts your health and your relationship with your friend . If your family is going to a movie to have family time maybe you will stay because you would stay home on the computer . That effects the relationship with your family . Most people rather stay on the computer than spend time working out . So that effects your health because most of the time your on the computer for a long time your going to end up hungry and keep eating and eating and since your not working out you get fat . Now your not working out and you just keep eating . So since you are not working out and your mind is always on the computer you can get sick . that is why most people are not healthy because of computers . Computers can mess up your relationships with family and friends . Sometimes your friend can ask you to go outside or to work out and you say no because your on the computer that messes up your relationship with your friend . Or your family can be having a movie night and your on the computer while they leave . That is messing up the relationship with your family . Being on the computer you can go nights without sleeping . I your playing a realy good game on the computer and it comes time for you to take a rest and since the game is so fun you do not sleep . Then after a while you get addicted and will not stop playing . So you will not get sleep and if you have school you will not be able to concentrate you will to busy worried about the game . So that is why computer are not so good . It can mess up your health . I can mess up your social life with family and friends . You will not get a lot of sleep and will not be able to concentrate .,8.0,124,4.254063651919108,17.0,22,0.33066666666666666,5.0,1.544,1.342019217819521,0.005333333333333333,22.0
8829,1132,1,"Dear Newspaper , I disagree that computers are important to people because they have research , online colleges , and online stores . Those are my top @ NUM1 reasons and I am going to give more details . My first main idea is that computers help students find important information help students find important information on a project . You can do on the wikepedia to help find information about the battle of @ LOCATION1 and other important history . one example is I went to american history . com to find good information about @ CAPS1 alley @ CAPS2 and what happened there . People also look up a lot of stuff that involves school . You can get research about the earth and what happens to it . My second main idea is that computers are good for people is when you finish high school , you can go to college . Some colleges can be found on the internet and you can go to college at home on your computer . One example is my cousin . She goes to college on the internet because she has to take care of her two children . Whenever you watch television you see a commercial about online colleges because they are trying to tell you to go to school online . My third and final reason why computers are good for you people is that some stores have an online store where you can look at what they have in the store . Children like to go shopping alot but they can not go to the mall or the stores because you do not want to go . You can let them see what they want and buy it online than going to the stores . It can be shipped to your door without going anywhere . My mom sometimes orders from @ CAPS3 . C @ CAPS4 so she does not have to go there . It gets shipped to our house in less than a week . There was my @ NUM1 main reasons why people should have a computer . They can find research , online schools , and online shopping stores . This can help people understand computers .",8.0,157,4.3840350111987165,14.73913043478261,23,0.461764705882353,6.0,1.5823529411764703,1.4910138707589942,0.023529411764705882,23.0
8830,282,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , I heard that you wanted some opinions on whether or not computers have a positive effect on people . I know that a lot of people are against these positive opinions but I think computers have a positive effect on people . The main thing that computers are great for is research . Without computers , kids an adults will not be provided with the necissary tools for knowledge . Studies show that @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 students have computers at home and that @ NUM3 person without computer access gets about @ PERCENT1 of a lower grade because of poor research ability on projects . Another reason why computers are good because it can bring the world together .

People in the @ LOCATION5 can play games and chat with people in @ LOCATION1 , @ LOCATION4 , @ LOCATION2 and even @ LOCATION3 ! My last reason is that computers are great for buiesnessess . A lot of people have websites for their jobs that can get them we will known and for people to know what their buisness is about . Take for example your newspaper . Without computers , you would not be able to get your research or even type or print your newspaper . Your website would not be able to persuade people to read your newspaper . Even though some people might abuse their computer privlages by staying on too long instead of exercising or interacting withpeople but that is them . it is only @ PERCENT2 of people with computers that do it ! And so what , it is their time and they want to spend it on the computer . What can you do to change ? Nothing . And with that , I conclude this letter by letting you know that computers are great for people ! They give us research , they help us with school and buiesnessess and they allow us to talk to people around the world .",8.0,160,4.141183286187872,16.0,20,0.4984423676012461,6.0,1.5919003115264798,1.57838982472352,0.04984423676012461,20.0
8831,271,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , I had heard about your problems with computers , and would like to state my opinion . I think that computers teach you more than they , disable you . For example , say you have a research project and you need to look someone up , you go on the computer and you got him . Also , say you want to go far for vacation ; like @ LOCATION1 . You can go on the internet and find out how they live there . My last reason is that now you can be on the computer and still interact with family and friends . First , I stated the first one because a couple of weeks ago I had a social studies research project . But ig I could not use a computer then I would of had to use a book ; instead of going on the computer and just looking it up . Another exsample could be like you need pictures to make the project look better . So you can go on google and find a picture to go with you project . But that is not all the internet can help you with . Like say you been planning a trip to @ LOCATION1 for your honeymoon but never been there or know anything about it , but your honeymoon is a month away . You can go on the computer and learn about it . Also now they have online classes and you can learn their language before you go . But to wrap it up I have on more exsample . Lastly , chatting sosme people think because you on the computer all day you can not interact with others , but you can . for exsample , like they have a website called @ ORGANIZATION1 . You can chat with all your friends at once . Also they have video chatting , so you can be looking right at the person while your talking , all that is all I can think of .

Recently , it has been bought to my attention that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers . I firmly believe that this is correct . My three arguments are it is not healthy , the friends you meet up there are siber friends and bad @ CAPS5 @ MONTH1 occur . First of all , being on the computer too much is not healthy . This reminds me of my friend named @ CAPS2 . @ CAPS2 used to be humerous , outgoing and play alot of sports . One @ CAPS3 day , her mother bought her a laptop . This laptop was blue and white - her two faverite colors . She was on it all day and all night . She took it with her everywhere she went . we will , it got to the point whare she stopped the sports , gained some weight and the sadness creptped upon her . She was in a depresion mode . She went to the doctors and they told her that she had to give up the computer and play with it for only two days a week for five hours only . She listened to the doctor and it took her about three months to get back to the fun @ CAPS2 she used to be . Being on the computer too much can harm you and the people around you . Second of all , the friends you meet on the enternet are called cyber friends . You do not know who they realy are , where they realy live , or their real age . They can tell you any thing they want because they know that that is a little fantasy world . That is mently not healthy . It is very important for human beings to be socialy active . Being on the computer too much can harm your brain also . Third of all , @ CAPS5 @ MONTH1 pop up . If you are the type of person who is on the computer every chance you get like becky , it is not good for you or the device . Being on the computer can harm even the computer . we will , you have read my arguments and ideas .

8833,1751,1,"Dear local newspaper , I strongly belive that computers do not benefit society as much as people think . I think that nature can provide all of the same qualatys than any computer can . A computure can not provide fitness , real interactions with friends of family , or experience in the real world . Did you know that @ PERCENT1 of children in @ LOCATION2 are overweight because of a lack of exercising ? Acording to @ CAPS1 @ PERSON1 . a @ ORGANIZATION2 and @ ORGANIZATION1 , computer systems are the leading cause of a lack of exercise . So why would a system that leads to obesity be considered a benefit to sociaty ? Anotherthing on that topic is that overweight children that spend @ NUM1 hours . Put off healthy activatys such as basketball or tennis wich also leaves them socialy behind and lacking he healthy experiences wich leads me to my next point . People think that computers know everything , but the truth is that their are vary little things you can experience on a computer . For example you @ MONTH1 read about world war @ CAPS2 but you realy know what people were thinking or what the combat fealt like ? A computer can not teach you how to feal only a real life experience can do so . Many if you were deployed to an army write in @ LOCATION1 . You would know what it is like to be in war . but playing a game or reading an article do not provide experience . My @ NUM2 explamation for how computers are not the greatest affect on scociaty is true life interactions with your family and friends . Their is only one true way to see family or friends and that is personally . People claim that they talk to their friends and family over the @ CAPS3 all the time but the only why to be satisfied is by seeing them for real for example a romantic relationship would fail if the only way they communicated was threw the @ CAPS3 . Unlike most relationships that sucseed . I hope my letter to your newspaper will get peoples attention , I would apretiate it if you joined my cause and help protect scociaty from dangerous computure technology that could cause , obesity , bad relations , and inexperience .",8.0,189,4.134828219756572,18.0,20,0.5235457063711911,6.0,1.6786703601108033,1.3609640474436813,0.06371191135734072,20.0
8834,1099,1,"Dear local Newspaper , @ CAPS1 opinion on the effects that computers have on people is that more and more obese people . People tend to get moody . and it seems that computers are addictive . I think computers have a huge effect on people . The nubmer one thing is that more people every year are becoming obese because they do not leave the chair they sit inside for most of the day . Also they get so lazy they do not want to get up so they will just order food and have it delivered right to their hause . The next idea is that they do not get enought exersise , because they is not sit there all day and do not move . But when they do move it is to get something to eat or go get their phone . This is why they should limit kids and adults to only @ NUM1 hours or less of computer time each day . @ CAPS1 next reason is because people that are on computers tend to get . Like one second they are happy and once they get off the computer they are sad . They get all couped up inside for the whole day . They do not see enough because people do not see they . If they hour each day the moody ness would change . People need lot of exersise to maintain weight and muscle . @ CAPS1 last receson the computers have effects on people is that people will tend to act addicted to the computer . Like if they are playing a game all day and do not realize it they will get addicted and not stop playing all day . People need to leave the computer and do something else like ride a bike or play a sport . In conclusion what I am trying to tell you taht it is not good that people stay inside all day and play on the computer , because it is hazardous to your health and it is putting you at a hgih risk of obesity .

8835,1152,1,"Dear local newspaper , I am writing to you today about how more and more people are using computers . I think that this is great . The reasons why I think so is because it teaches hand - eye coordination , it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people , and it also allows people to talk online with other people . Keep reading to find out more . The first reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it teaches people better hand - eye coordination , for example , there could be a program for the computer that teaches you to type with your hands and not just your index fingers . You then can learn how to do all this without even looking at the keyboard . Keep reading for more information . The second reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people . For example , if you have a project for school and you are doing research on another country , you could use your computer to get more information about their religions or just the whole country in general . You can also use the computer to look up different kinds of people . You can look up people like @ PERSON1 from @ DATE1 ' s to @ PERSON2 who is our presiden now . Keep reading for more information . The last reason why I think that more and more people are using computers is because it allows people to talk online with other people .

You could get to know some kids who live in you neighborhood that you never even knew . Keep reading to find out more .

For starters , I would like to say that my first subject is communication , computers allow us to talk to everyday folks or folks that are around the world ! There are many ways to talk , text , speech , and webcam , and it is not like you cannot talk to them there are hundreds of communication cients , servers online @ NUM1 usually , so you will always be able to someone !

There are @ CAPS4 , @ CAPS5 , @ CAPS6 , reading , book sites all on the web !

On a game a user @ MONTH1 talk to friends , while @ CAPS14 a game such as a ( @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 ) for example @ CAPS10 @ CAPS11 @ CAPS12 online , @ CAPS13 @ CAPS14 game . These kinds of games skyrocket entertennent lovers for the vast ammount of enjoyment they can endure while @ CAPS14 a @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 . Another type of entertennent is videos people can watch videos and movies on a video and more website which has a database of not thousands but millions of videos and movies . Whatever the user wants is a text and a click away ! The last type of entertennent is @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS18 , these allow the user to daily life or take to friends , family or relatives .

My reasons for wrint this is because computers allow people to talk online to others people learn about faraway places , and finally it teacher hand - eye coordination . As you read my letter I hope you fell the same way . First of all computers allow you to talk to other people online . The reason I feel this way is what if you can not fond your fone in your hose or even your cell phone , you could see if they were online . Also it is the same thing as texting , but with a bigger keyboard / screen I can relate to this because I was texting someone and went online to find whtm on too , so we sent aims to each other instead . I hope you can see why computers can be good for people . Secondly not a lot of people will go to the library to look up information for a paper for a school . The reason I feel this way is a computer has google to make finding things easier . Another reason is going to the library @ MONTH1 cause you send more money to fill up your gas tanks . I can relate this because everytim my family goes to the library we have to fill the car up after we go . This is another reasons why computers a good . Finally the computers can teach hand - eye coordination . The reason for this is because if your writing an email then you should know the keys that your fingers touch . Another reasons why computers are hand - eye coordination is because if your kid take karayta then might have learned to move there hands that fast from somewhere . I can relate ti this because when I was in the first grade there was a guy that you told me and my friends that be need us to get in the truck to help him find his lost puppy , and he tried grabbing me but I pulled my hard away before I became pinned . I hope you can see why we need computers . I would like to that the I for sitting and reading my essay .

And besides , most kids do not do not stay on the computer very long anyways . Homeworks , it is a big role in school , if you do not do it or worse do not get it can you down . that is why computers have websites that help a child learn how do do a problem or a social studies question if they do not know . If you go to the school web page then theres a link that brings you in a math games . Theres even a to a science website . This helps a child so they do not get stressed out over homework . A computer also helps a students interact with friends . A social life is very important to a @ NUM1 grater . This is where a computer can have aim , facebook , and even myspace help a kid impact with friends . If a kid got into a fight at school can come home and to work it out and not leave it unseatled . A computer also new friends from other towns . Teens need to and make new friesnd will helps as in life . If a teen helps with a then they can ask a for help . Every student gets a take home project at social point in the time of running out to the store to buy paper and pencils . you can stay home , have money and typee the essay . Computers can help with a social studies or a science project . You can print pictures and find information . Drawing can be a hastle and messy , so it saves time and the mess . If @ CAPS1 are words you do not understandd then you can look them out . Computers are and best way to do a project . Computers , everyone uses them , they help our parents just as much as uss .

My first reason for this is , a lot of kids have friends online that can not text or even talk on the phone , so this is another easier way to talk to them .

If people spent less time on computers they would exersice more , be outdoors more and spend more time with their family and freind . If people were to spend less time out computers than they would exersize more . With the growingproblem of obesity in @ ORGANIZATION2 less time on computers would help this .

If we did not have computers or use them we would probably use books . We would get information from the books but not as much as we would get from the computer . We probably would not know that much if it was not ofr computers . The reason why computers have a positive effect is because you work your eyes and while you are typing you are exercising your hands . That proves hand - eye coordination . We learn about places we do not live in like that ? Had a earthquake we went on websites for that . You get to learn how it is in a certain place you want to go on vacation for . You get to learn about famous people you do not know about so all you have to do is go on the computer and look up your celebrity .

These websites can get a person to be willing to be on computer instead of exercising and staying healthy . I believe kids like me these day want to keep in touch with their friends .

These experts that are concerned also say people need to enjoy nature , and interact with family and friends more . These experts @ MONTH1 be smart but they are wrong . I am going to tell you how they are wrong . My first example is that people that go on the computer alot still exercise . Take twitter as a example . The football player ocho - cinco "" tweets "" all the time but that does not mean he does not get exercise . There are plenty of sports players that are on twitter and they are fit . Most of the kids in my grade including me have a facebook . Most of the kids are fit . Just because they are on the computer alot does not mean they can not exercise . My second example is the effect of the computer . Students use the computer for a lot of things . We use wikipedia for are projects and research a person . Some schools know a day almost depend on computers . I rember when I lived in country we never had to reely type anything unless it was a project . When I moved to @ CAPS3 I am always typing something . Even a rough draft they want me to type . In couentry I would write out my final draft . I have to use the computer . Schools also are teaching us about the computer @ CAPS4 as we learn more and more things on the computer we are on the computer more and more . When someone . Finds out a new website there going to tell there friends and there going to pass it on and @ CAPS4 on . My third example is how the experts say that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time interacting with family and friends . My grandpa , aunt , other family members have a facebook account . That means I can still interact with family and friends . The people that are the computer alot that are adults probably do not have family over every night and probably go out with friends evey once in a while . Computers also benefit Society for buisness people they might have to a powerpoint and they have a computer . When experts say we need to enjoy nature , interact with family and friends , and do more excising they might be right but we can do all these things but we can also still go on the computers .

8855,288,1,"Dear newspaper , I think that using your computer too much is bad . Some people spend way too much time on the internet . Many people are too focused on the internet and they lack on their normal activities . Also , the computer is bad for people because they will be on the internet all night and get no sleep . This leaves them exausted for the day ahead . Alot of people spend too much time on the internet . Since they are always on the internet , they do not spend alot of time with their families . This causes the internet addicted person to lose relationships with their family and friends . Not exercizing is a result of this addiction also . For example , my stepbrother is always on the internet now . He does not talk to anyone because he is so preoccupied with his game . Another problem people encounter with the internet is being too focused . When you are too focused on the internet , you forget there is a whole world out there that needs your help , most people will not do their choires , or make a meal for their family . These people also have no time for their outdoor activities they used to enjoy . Internet addicts usually do not get any sleep . They have no time to study at night because they spend all their extra time on the internet . During the day , they will be very tired in school or work and the internet will be the one to blame . Last month my mom made a facebook . She is constantly on it . When she is on she ignores everything around her . My mom goes to school and she tells me how she never has time to study because she always on the internet . She also stopped reading the bible in her spare time to go on the internet . The internet is a bad thing to get hooked on . You lose relationships with your friends and family because you never get off the computer . People usually do not exercize or do thier chores .

The computers connect families , contain information which is great for peoples education , and are very conveint . Computors are a step into the future and we should take advantage of it . First off the internet or e - mail will help family members connect . My family , which lives @ NUM1 hours away by car , love to talk with me by e - mail . This helps me connect with my family and is just another reason why we should have computors . Another reason that includes family is when the family is just sitting around and are calling everywhere just to find a board game , it would just be easier to go online to find it . This way it would be quick and easy to find that one board game . The last reason why a computer would help a family is if a family wants to get in to any kinds of activities and they need the number they could just go online . On the internet the family could find the numbers , the and some information about it . This way more and more families can do activities together . As one can see the computer is bringing more and more families together . An other reason why the computers are good for society is educations . With information at the tip of your fingers more and more people will want to learn . Now a days people try to find the out , but will all the tools on the computers mae people get the education . Secondly computers are another way to go to collage . If you arn ' t up to going to school / collage because your sick . You would not have to miss anything because with a click of a button you will have the materials needed for what was missed . Lastly everyone knows that in @ LOCATION2 most classrooms can not afford one computer . The children want computors so hard . If they were to get one it would change so much . They would be able to learn so much more than before . The children could lean about different countries far away . As a result computers would improve the way we learn . The last reason why computers are so helpful is convience . Now a say the world is crazy , so if we do not have to go out or talk to someone we will not . The computer will offer the ability to confrence will other people so that there would be communication between work parttners . With the ability to talk with another for work would make us a lighter nation . This is only one of the many reasons computers are very conviente , subssiquently computers are conviente because you could book flights , vacations , rentals , and much more . With a click of a button you should be going to @ CAPS1 or a nice vacation .",8.0,208,4.791038418717472,15.766666666666667,30,0.4388185654008439,6.0,1.5738396624472577,1.07462769858425,0.02109704641350211,30.0

You can talk or web chat with friends . This one time online I found my old friend from @ LOCATION1 , that I havened seen in five years . Whenever I come home from school I will go on the computer and talk to all my friends . The computers a great place to make plans or to catch up with some buddies . My next reson for why they benifit society is theirs so much to do . it is like an at home amusment park . The internet is a wonderfull thing . either to do home work or play games . even some @ ORGANIZATION1 I will just sit down for two or three hours and just play a game . But , i still exercise daily . yes , computers can get addicting but , it is always good to go outside and exersise . Many people say over @ PERCENT1 of the @ CAPS1 . population has a computer , and @ PERCENT2 check email or go on the computer every ten minutes . yes it is not heathy but it is their dissition . In conclution I belive computers are indeed benifical .

8862,911,1,In my opinion I think that computers have a good affect on people . I think this because about millions of people use computers everyday ! The affects on them are that people get learn things easier . There are millions of a job sites that would have to do with something of learning . About @ NUM1 of collage students go online and do challenge . If you were a collage student and did collage online you would : see your family more will not be a hassle to get to collage and would be easier to concentrate being by your self and learning . Also they even make stone which is very popular learning a different language and where you learn this from is on a computer . My second reason is to talk on the . About @ NUM2 of our daily ! Online phone you and you can also the cool them even more that have you talk to give . I know have a facebook give do not get think it would be a good chore . up free . So in conclusion I think that there good effects on people that use cpu . Also when everyone that uses their cpu they still enjoy the nature talk to thier family .

I play lots of sports and I love them all . I am fit and yes I do like going on @ CAPS1 and chatting with my friends , but that is not as important as is breathing fresh air and playing sports with your friends . Yes , the computer has all different kinds of bad stuff and good stuff . I mean you could learn about faraway places with out going there , but then what would be the fun of that . For an example , if you go to @ LOCATION1 for snowboarding , do not you feel great when your going down that @ CAPS3 ? I know I do instead of being home on the computer .

If you spend all of your time on the computer doing whatever your doing you will not have time to go out and exercise . Not only will it be in appeling but it could be dangerous for your health after a while . All your time gets sucked into the computer and when your on it you feel like your not on for a long time and it ends up being like a few hours . It even happens to adults , my mom was on the computer for about an hour and she felt like it was only a few mins . When your on your computer for several hours you tend to got sucked in and not interact with anyone . I know this from experience . A few months ago I spent about a whole month just coming home from school and being on the computer for several hours . This effected my life a lot , I stopped going out on weekends with my friends , I always wanted to stay home when my family will not out . Then my mom confronted me about it and I realized all of my time on the computer was not good . I was missing out on a lot of things .

Speaking of quizzes that teachers make on the computer , they can also make alot of other things like power points . Power points can help them put alot of information on the screen and it helps the students learn , which is a positive effect . If you had a small business that just started out you can make a brochure to help advertising . Lastily , you can go on microsoft excel and make a schedule that can help your employees know who has to work when , or students can know what class they have to be in at what time . In conclusion , computers are very helpful in everyday for alot of different people . Talking to worldwide can help you stay in , so you do not lose connection with your . They also have effect they help business people stay organized . Lastly , they can help teachers create test or powerpoints which helps kids learn . So in all , I would have to agree that computers have a positive effect on society .

But , I mean those are only my opinions . we will I am gonna just go ahead and explain them to you . The good thing about computers is that it teaches you hand - eye coordination which helps you see better with your eyes . Also it helps you with your hands by making you learn how to catch stuff and how to react quickly with your hands . For example I was playing baseball and I could not catch very good and I was also learning how to use the computer and because I was able to type fast my hands reacted when I got grounders and pop fly ' s hit to me . So I was so happy that I lerned how to use the computer and type . But for sure the computer is the best because you can research stuff and you find out more important facts . Also you are learnen more when ever you research anything . I will tell you one thing though , I like the computer so much because it helps me find out important details and facts about the person that I am doing my project on . Yes I know the computer is so fun because you can go on different websites such as myspace . com , youtube . com , and funnyjunk . com . I go on mspace to talk to my friends and to meet new people that is what I like about myspace I meet new people and make new friends . I go on youtube because I like to listen to music and I watch music videos on their also I watch skate board videos too cause I love to skate ! But one thing for sure is that I go on funnyjunk . com to play games cause they have so much fun games that you can play . But my favorite game is @ CAPS2 the hedgehog .

My first reason is about searching new places and meeting new people . People that have computers can go on google and search for a place they want to go and there they meet new people and that way they do not have to be on the computer that much they will be too busy with their new friends . My second reason is when people have nothing to do . If people have nothing to do they can always invite friends over and on the computer they watch movies without going to the movie theater and they do not have to pay . All you could do is download it . And also thre are many websites of movies . My last reasong is about how teenagers cants be without the computer . teenagers are teenagers they must have technology . If yu take the computer away from them they went do enything else . That will be even worse because if you tell them to go outside they will not do it same will . Maybe what you can do is let them use the computer but they can use it outside only if it is a laptop .

Here are three reasons to support my oppinion people learn more on the internet , children at school can go online to find what was for homework , and how the internet does not effect everyday life . My first reason why I think using computers is good because people learn more on the internet , You know what people say , you learn something new everyday . we will , if you are wondering about something or if you are think about something , the internet can help you find what you are looking for , @ ORGANIZATION1 is a great site to find what you are looking for . It also has it is own images if you need a picture for your project you need . My second main reason to why using the internet is good because if your a @ CAPS1 , you can go online to check what you have for each subject . If your a @ CAPS1 and you do not want to do homework at recessthe next day from being sick . No , you can go online to your schools website and click on your teachers names to see what you have for homework . This way you can still have time to go out side , play with friends , and interact with family members . My third and final reason to why using the internet is good is that it effects everyday life , in a good way . If you do not have a t . v . and you have no idea what the weather is like , you can go online to see if it is going to be snowy , or rainy . This can tell you if you need a jacket or a rain jack , if you need to use a shovel or hold an umbrella . The internet can be useful in everyday life .

Computers can be very helpful , when trying to find information on a topic , but some people take it too far . Some people , their jobs are on computers . Others like teenager will do gaming or have instant messengers , which sometimes takes away from outside activities . Another situation with computers is that adults can get really into online gambling which is terrible for a person to do even at a casino , but now they can do it from their living room couch . Computers can also keep you in from outside , to get fresh air and sunlight . Computers are bad in someways but good in others . Sometimes computers are a pefect resource . When your history teacher assigns you a @ NUM1 page essay on the civil war and you have no idea what happend in the civil war . In this case computers are good . Or your boss could tell you to find the amount of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones . Computers seem like a perfect resource .

8887,787,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , In my opinion , spending too much time online has negative effect on society . People are not getting a full social experience when they talk on email , facebook and twitter . Being on such sites has taken up time that could be spent in other areas , such as family , friends and school . They are not being able to enjoy the outdoors and being able to exercise . Though online activity can be helpful spending too much time can be harmful . Interacting online can be a great experience for those who have friends and family who live far away . But spending too much time online can damage you social activity levels . In person interaction is better than online , because you see how the person you are talking to is reacting to everything you say . Having a good , positive social environment is benificial to you and your friend . Spending too much time on the computer can also damage you social relationship with your family . For family who live far away , and online is the only way to socialize , online interaction is a great thing to have . But for you close family , you could be missing out on their lives and how they are doing . Your relationship with you family could be in jeoporady because you insist on using your computer .

They say they are working on hand - eye coordination , but in reality they are wasting away their lives on a chair . They do not communicate as much with the rest of the household and that does not make a big , happy family . They say they are getting important information , but in truth , they might just be getting false information and viruses . Bad people are out there , and one might hack into your computer and ruin your day . Things like @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 and @ CAPS6 could have people that want to find out all about you so they can hurt you . Yes , being on the computer definitely has a bad side . But there is a good side as we will . That is , as long as you are not on too much . It does improve hand - eye coordination , if you play the right games . And it can teach you things , too . Many websites have true information about place or things so you do not need to see it to know about it . You can be helpful . It is also an easy way to purchase items . You can just order them . Most importantly , you can have fun . So , what is your side on this argument ? Do you think way too many people are on the computer . Or do you think computers can be great , as long as you are careful ? I , for one , pick the latter one . What about you ?",8.0,160,4.566758732081572,11.851851851851851,27,0.4984423676012461,5.0,1.5015576323987538,1.5304930567574826,0.018691588785046728,27.0

Computers also have abilities to download videos and other soft ware that people can look at and perform excersing with them , and learn techniques .

8902,622,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , do not you think that nature is better than spending way too much time in the computer ? we will , generally speaking , I think it is and I will give you only three reasons why . First of all , it is about the obesity percentage in @ LOCATION1 . Second , you can spend a lot more time with your family . Finally , you can enjoy what nature has to offer . I think that the great outdoors is the way to go because @ LOCATION1 needs some exercise rather than spending time in the computer . Also because the obesity percentage rate is advancing up really high . In @ DATE1 , @ PERCENT1 are obese or overweighted . Last year in @ DATE2 , it was @ PERCENT2 . Wow , the rate went went up like @ PERCENT3 in each year . This info was online at www . tomatotalks . org . Another thing I would like to consider , spending more time with a family or even a friend is a good thing . All statistics show that spending time with your family anywhere especially at the dinner table is a great way to talk about your child ' s problem ' s in school , and also to learn their parent ' s mistakes too . Also share great laugh ' s . Finally the most important thing is what they will do for their future . Last , but not least , you can enjoy the greater outdoors , and also discover some of the most important creatures such as insects , reptiles , and mammals . These creatures are the most important things in our life to learn about . Also trees that gives us oxygen too . Mother nature has it is great benefits when your career is all about science .

8903,890,1,"I think that computers have positive effects on peole . People can find out important news online , and you can connect with people you do not see often . Also , you can order anything in the world online . These are three reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people . Computers inform people about important news . If there is a blizzard people can find out ahead of time and stock up on food . If there is a burglar going around , people can find out , and lock all doors and windows . And by knowing all this information , it helps helps people plan events , like birthday parites . Finding out important news is very helpful , and conveniant . And @ PERCENT1 of people , are less to inconveniances , if they know the news . Another way computers have a positive effect on people is by allowing them to connect with people they do not see often . This provides an easy way to share events tha have taken place , and just have some time to talk face to face . With video chat , you can show off new , or newborn baby . You can share you want with people you barely see . Experts say that freindships last longer if you talk to each ohter often . and with computers , this is possible . A third way computers help out is allowing you to order anything in the world online . If you need a japanese doing for someone in ohio , you can order it online . If you are are old , and can not go to the grocery store anymore , you can order then online . I have seen that people who can order everything online , do not have to do a lot of driving , and this saves time , money , and gas .

Secondly , it allows people to talk online with friends . Thirdly , gives online games to little kids . Lastly you can wacth video ' s that can teach you all sorts of exotic things . My first reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places .

My second reason computers have affect on people is because it allows people to talk online with other people whenever they want .

Some computers are also just for at home use and are used to contact family members and find information that you @ MONTH1 need instantly or would not be able to find any were . Computers are still developing and are becoming faster and better day after day and most likely will never be put out of use but then does not mean they will permanently restrict you from othere activeties . It is true some people do spend to much time on computer but not everyone does , some people work from home computer and can not help being on it because it is their job . I implore you to consider the resonse computers are used so much and to understand that computers are used to help not hurt people . Computers are very helpfull in simplying things and are very useful for information . I stand strong with the use of computers and strongly disagree that they negatively affect hte way of human life . Computers do th things people would normaly not do for example someone would not go and look up every thing he or she needs to know in a look because there be only certain facts there looking for and it would also be easy to compare and contrast information on a computer rather than reading several diferent books .

It helps out in many ways for example , to keep in touch with relatives , to learn new information and to keep you safe and updated . Computers are vital to everyday life and we need them . A huge purpose of computers is to keep in touch . With new programs like "" @ CAPS2 "" and "" @ CAPS3 "" and "" @ CAPS4 "" , it leaves you with all sorts of new opportunities to keep in touch and have fun with your friends that were not previously available . Email as we will , is a great taol to keep in touch with family that are far away opposed to the good ' ol letter which @ MONTH1 take a web in the mail . Another huge reason why we need computers today is to be able to reaserch foreign places and learn facts that without a computer you would never even heard of . With computers , it makes it possible to go online , look up the @ ORGANIZATION1 , research it and plan a flight there a week later . It is also a great tool to learn new things that he did not know previusly . It is a huge step up in the education process . Computers also provide us with extreme saftey and security as we will as breaking news . Imagine how much simpler it would be to be able to be at home and go on the computer to check the best rout home opposed not and consequently sitting intinse . With modern day technology all that is possible . They add great saftey and protection to average people like you and me . In conclusions , hopefully your mind has been changed on the topic of computers , or if you already were in support , that as we will is great . Now you are being asked to spread the word about how great computers are and how vital they are to ensuring a better future . I understand that some people do not enjoy electronics but it is up to you to set them straight !

This is concerning fact because more and more kids each year turn in less and less in school work because they have better things to do such as chat with their friends or watch funny video online . it is a scary though because these children are our future leaders . This is a critical point in their lifes . They need to learn about things now so their futures are not hanging by a thread . Instead of making a habit of going online everyday why not make a habit like try to get all your homework done each night ? Things in childrens lifes need to change before they pay for it later in life . To sum it up , many things about our lifestyles need to change . Wether it be in schoool work or losing weight .

One of my examples of why I disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone . This is a great idea ! What if your friend moved a few states over would not you still want to communicate ? we will , with high long - distance rates , many cna ' t afford this and how would you see your friend anymore ? we will , if you send her pics , or video chat over the web , you can ! Also , it is a great idea if you want to send a small mesage like "" see you at @ NUM1 "" , instead of saying it on the phone , and paying more , when it is free on the computer . The computer also teachs hand - eye coordiantion that is important to use in the world . You can play games , take quiza and tests , go to school on the internet , even listin to music , that is important for us to express . Also there are sites that allow you to learn how to use a keyboard , and work electronics like a computer !

This helps you do a project on a place you have never been , plan a family reunion or vacation , or find a place where you can have that fun in the shining sun , many people think that too many people are staying in front of their computer than exercising and being outside . To prevent that , they should just limit themselfs to the amount of computer and electronic time they have per day and then go exercise go to a faraway place .

I mean it is ok to go on the computer once and a while to learn but that is why they have books , and school to learn about things . My second reason was going out - side and the reason for that is because people need to get fresh air and not be locked inside all day . Another one was to explore and go on a hike to see what is out there and just have a good time . My other reason was nature . And what I mean by that is you can go to the zoo and learn about stuff there to . Another thing is that you can do much more with out being on the computer all day long . My last reason was you can talk to your friend about stuff , you can go to the mall all day , you can also hang out with your friend and have a sleep over and watch movies . You do not need to stay on the computer all day you need to have fun . This is why I say you do not need to be on the computer .

Computers are useful for homework , it allows you to keep in touch with out of state family , you can also look up direction and information to a place . Computers are good for last minute situations . Computers are very useful for homework because when you type a report it looks more professial . While you type a report you can also research on your project at the same time . In some cases there are people who write very slappy to a paint where he or she cannot read his own writing nor can a teacher . A sloppy writer can use the computer to make his or her paper neat . If a child or parent cannot go to the library for some reason they can use their computer at home . If you are a parent at home busy with kids and need to do work ; there ' s no need to go anywhere stay home and use your computer . If a child is absent from school you can go to the school ' s website and find out the homework . Do you have out of state family you wish to talk to ? If so would not you want to be a able to talk to them without a expensive phonebill ? A majority of people would say yes . Using the computer to keep touch with family is not so expensive at all ! Some examples are aim , emails , and other networks and they do not cast money at all it is free . When there ' s a day you have nothing to do , do not you just want to go somewhere for fun ? do not you want to do something just to get out of the house ? we will if there ' s a last minute decision or situation the computers there to help .

I will now explain to you why the time we spend on computers is needed by stating these three reason . My first reason I will like to state that will convince you with the time we spend on computer ' s are needed is it helps us with information and it teaches stuff about place ' s , people , culture and more it teaches us useful information which takes a while to learn so the time we spend on computeres is needed to learn new information . My second reason I will like to state that will convince you with . The time we spend on computer ' s are needed is it helps us to become smarter . Say if you needed help with fractions you can go on a math site it helps you with it . Computers make you become become smarter . And at the end of the day it is about who is smarter not who does more excerise . My third and final reason which contribute to why we spend the time we spend on computer are needed because it teaches you good hand - eye coordination because it help with typing and become more faster to do essay ' s and when you have good hand - eye coordination you do not make a lot of mistake ' s typing . So I have come to my conclusion why a lot of computer time is needed because it helps with information , you become smarter , and it teaches good hand - eye coordination this is why a lot of computer time is needed probably even more computer time is needed .

Computers are common by now , but people argue rather they are really needed on our society . Computers give negative effects on people , for example , lose eye sight , interacting with strangers online and lack of outdoor exercise . One out of five people wear glasses or contacts , these days . the rate of people wearing glasses are increasing rapidly as we will . Children and adults are spending too much time on the computer , which causes to lose eye sight . When people use too much computers , their eyes start to hurt and lead to a headaches as we will . These are sign of spending too much time , but people tend to ignore it because they want to get work done , or simply addicted to the online video games . this shows that computers give terrible effects on society . When a person is on the internet , there is no limitation to him or her . Once a person is online , there are endless amounts of site to access on that are not always trusted . Online , where anyone can go on , there are millions of people that are not connected or related . In other words , strangers , interacting with people they do not know is very dangerous . They can have devastating influence , no supremacy , what so ever unless they are a teacher of same sort . Unfortunatly , people can not trust anyone online because they do not know who it exactly is . For example facebook . People think they are private , but everything that is uploaded or posted is public . Also others will be able to view your profile even they are not friends with that person . this is not safe in any way . The rate of people getting addicted on the internet is increasing as we will . These people tend to not go outside at all and stay home . These people get not enough exercises , which are very unhealthy they tend to get their meals done at fast foods which are unhealthy as we will . For the reason , people on the computers get fat from the unbalanced meal and never interact with people outside and nature outside . In conclusion , computers have negative effects on society because , they increase the number of people wearing glasses and losing eye sight .

Yes , computers have benefits such as talking to friends and family you do not see that often , doing school work , and gathering information .

Sure , computers let you interact with friends in family via e - mail , or @ CAPS2 messaging , or social networking websites such as @ CAPS3 or @ CAPS4 . Guess what ? You can easily communicate the old fashioned way with cell phones , or even writing a letter . See ? There are alternitives for communication . Exercise is so important now a days , and people do not get enough of it . Did you know that obesity , has gone up @ PERCENT1 since last year ? that is a fairly big percentage , and we do not want it to get any bigger . If people are wasting away , staring at their computer screen and not getting any sort or exercise in , the number will get bigger . Also , computers can cause all kinds of medical problems . For example , about a month ago my back was really bothering me . I went to the doctors and he told me one of the likley causes was leaning foward togo on my laptop . "" Computers can also cause vision problems and haedaches . "" says specialist @ CAPS5 . Oz . We can prevent these issues if we take a stand against computers !

There are many groups you can join too , wich allows you to talk to other people and meet new friends . You can also interact with your family if they have a facebook or @ CAPS1 . The second reason why computers are not bad is because that there are many websites that you can find different information like science , math , history and all that kind of stuff . There are alot of different topics you can learn . You can find information from the weather to where your family history comes from . My last reasoning for thinking this way is that many kids do their homework on computers and if people are saying that computers are bad than the parents are not going to allow them to use the computer for educational purposes like homework and projects . There are many other reason why computers have a positive effects of people .

8949,1352,1,"Dear Newspaper , @ CAPS1 the years , the streets have become less crowded with people interacting exercising , and enjoying nature . Is this good or bad ? Technology has advanced so far that it might be better to stay home and on the computer than taking a walk in the park . Computers do have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage exercise , advertisements that encourage travel and enjoying nature , and computers allow people to interact from anywhere in the world . Firstly , computers are full of great advertisements . Some advertisements talk about joining a gym and exercising . Studys show that < @ PERCENT1 @ NUM1 > of kids without computers do not get enough exercise , whereas only @ PERCENT1 of kids with computers do not get enough exercise . These statistics show that computers are better for people ' s health than they are thought to be . Next , computers have even more advertisements that encourage people to travel around the world . By doing this , people ' s intellegence will increase because they will learn new facts about new places . Also , people will be happier because they enjoy travel . Lastly , people ' s jobs will benefit it they are business depends on the advertisements they post on the internet . Finally , the technology used in computers today allows people to talk to friends from nearly anywhere in the world on a computer . Social sites such as facebook alow people to see pictures from where their friends have traveled . Webcams allow people to talk face to face up close about the new gym they joined . < @ PERCENT1 @ NUM2 > of people say they have a better social life online then out in the open when their friends might not be there to talk . I conclusion , computers have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage people to exercise , encourage travel , and computers allow people to talk from anywhere in the world .

We need to know what is going on around us , all the time . We need to know what is happening and what is happening with other people in our lives . We need to know the weather / traffic conditions if you have children you need to know if the school is open and if you work in places that use computers for information , you need to check if your boss or co - worker sent you anything important that you need to know about . The second reason why I support advances in technology is because we can chat with friends and family online . We can chat with our family and friends on the other side of the world who have computer . Most of us want to know if our family and friends are ok and healthy , even though we can not see them in person . I , for one , knows this is fact because my family and friends touch each other online . Staying communicated with our family and friends keeps our boats strong .

8952,18,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , I must admit that the experts are centainly right cause I know people that stay on the computer all day and that is really not good if you ask me . Instead of being on computers learning about faraway places , and talking to other people , you should go exercising , you should relax , and you should interact with family and friends . Exercising is much more better than being on a computer , and I say that to say this . When your on a computer just sitting there playing online games and checking other things out , or whatever the case @ MONTH1 be , you get board , and hungry , and I know theres some snacks around you while your doing whatever your doing . Instead of being on a computer for @ NUM1 or @ NUM2 hours or maybe even all day getting fat . There are many ways you can exercise . You can take walks , you can go joggin , you could play a sport , I mean there are a lot of things you can do when your not on a computer . I know some people that could be workin all day and still come home to there computer . Rest is good also . You do not always have to jump on your computer , you could just relax watch a movie , eat some pop corn and just enjoy yourself , you could even take a nap for a little while or something but you do not always have to get straight on your computer if you really do not have to use it . The way I see it is family , and computers are always going to be there but at the same time which one is more important . Friends are not always dependable so you really do not need them around only a selected few , but that is not the point . Both family , and your true friends have feelings , and if your not spending time with them over a computer that your gonna have when you leave , and come back home too something is not right . Tomorrow is not promised , we live for today .

I think that the effect is good because every place needs them they store thing neatly that way you will know that when you go back it will be neat and saved . Every place uses computers they are a big thing . Hotels use them to save who is in each room and to actuvate the room keys , restarunts use them to help make the bill , hospilas use them to store flies so they can be printed heat so the doctor can go to look at them and understand . And schools use them they need them to store grades neatly , or for an student to to type up a paper neatly and hand it in they could leave it for the day and go back to it tomorrow . The computer can also be you job , like you workinh on them like fixing them or installing a @ ORGANIZATION1 programor app . You can also do your work on it like working on a website or once agin just writing a boper . The biggest company @ MONTH1 need an computer even the @ ORGANIZATION1 need them they are big in you company .

8954,278,1,"Dear local newspaper , I think that computers effect people in a positive way . Computers increases our knowlage , lets us communicate with our friends and family , teaches us hand - eye coordination , and lets us see our news faster . Computers are enjoyable , great pieces of technology . Even though sitting down looking at your computer screen is not very interactive , computers increase our knowlage . Computers have all these websites that are full of great information . You can look up anything you would like to learn about and find exactly what you want . Going to the library for a book on your report would consume extra time . Instead you can look up the facts you need online . Computers also let us communicate with family and friends . Calling someone or sending a letter costs money , but sending on email to someone does not . Many people have family and friends that live far away from them . Through computers they can talk to them as long as they want at no expense . You can also see each other through a webcam . Which you can attach to your computer if it has not have in one allready . Another reason why computers are useful is because they help with hand - eye coordination . Computers require you to type , which is a great skill . While working out an essay by hand is tiring and boring you can type up the essay on you computer . Typing takes to get good at but is very helpful . Finally Computers help us get our news foster . When major things happen , such as the earthquake in @ LOCATION1 it was all over the internet before the news .

8955,1360,1,"I support the advance in technology especially in computers . Using the computer can teach hand - eye coordination , give you the ability to learn about faraway places or people , and give you the opportunity to talk online with other people . Hand - eye coordination is a very important skill to have . it quickens reflexes during everyday life . Hand - eye coordination is needed especially for sports like baseball , football , or basketball . Without computers , many people would lack hand - eye coordination . If you are driving a car on the highway , when suddenly a car swerves onto the wrong side of the road and is heading toward you , you need to react fast . Without hand - eye , you could die . Using computers could possibly save your life one day . If somebody wants to go to a foreign country , but does not know anything about it , he could lost it we on the internet . The internet is a major part in having computers . Without it , people probably would not be able to research a country with ease or learn about other people . Some people @ MONTH1 think that using the computer too much restricts people from getting exercise , which is true in some cases , but the computer is very useful to have if you want to know about something . Like who won the election , or who won the sports championship . The computers is almost a neccesity in every home . The computer gives people the opportunity to chat online with other people . Some they @ MONTH1 know in real life , or some they met online . It expands peoples interactive life , helping them make new friends . Though this is great thing to have acces to , it is still important to socialize with people in person , rather than socializing online .

However some people should limit themselves on things like facebook and twitter , some people spend too much time on those things and should limit themselves to just @ NUM1 minutes a day on those sites . One of the reasons I think computers are good is because some students might not now the answer to something on their homework and could use the computer to find out the answers . Another reason why computer can be very valueable to all students is because lets say a student has a quiz on mitusis and cells in science the next day and does not really understand it they could use the computer to learn about it and do good on their quiz .

My second reason is to you could talk to your friends and family online like if one of your relatives live long distance like in @ LOCATION2 then you can talk to them on your telephone or cellphone because the bill will outragouse . Or if you talk to your friends online so can ask them a question on homework or what is the homework ? Like if you have a that to like @ LOCATION1 you can to online and you can talk to them . My third reason is that you can even do your homework on the computer . If you have history you can go on a website for an online book instead of bringing a book to school and back to home . Also it will be easier for that you would not have to worry about bringing your history book with to home . For the example it will take less time using the interneat the using a book it will take like @ NUM5 to @ NUM2 minutes using the computer then using the book for @ NUM5 to @ NUM8 minutes . In my conclusion using a computer is very useful and very important nowadays . My three reasons are to look up information , homework and talking online to friends and family . Even though people do not like computers or do not like to use them .",8.0,127,4.0408118895823,19.944444444444443,18,0.3527777777777778,5.0,1.5888888888888888,1.0,0.03333333333333333,18.0

These are some internet sources that are @ NUM1 to answer questions . @ CAPS1 we did not have computers , then @ CAPS1 you have a question , then you would have to go find a book to read in and that takes much more work . Another reason why computers are a good things is because you can catch up on all of the recent stories . You can learn about what is happenings in other parts of the world , you can learn things about celebrities , and you can look at the weather . You can find all this cut on television , but you never knows when it would come on . With computers , you can search all the latest stories and find things cut when you want to know them .

For many students , they need computers to help them understand their subjects . There are certain websights that give online lessons .

Also the computor is a good souce of entertainment . You can play a number of games off the internet . You can even down load consal games onto your computor . Another thing you can do is watch full episodes of @ CAPS3 shows and movies like if you wer fallewing a telivison selles and you missed an episode you can just go look it up . And a favorit of mine is youtube wether you watch random videos watch famous youtube stars on post videos of your own ther is always fun to be had . And finaly all the programs on the computer ther is an endless amont of programs you can have downloaded they can be for fun such as paint and flash or they can be important like worn or knot book every program tha computer offers is usefull and fun to use and you can use most of these programs to help you in the real .

People will take maps for a while and not want to go back to sleep and you wont have nothing else to do for the rest of the day . Sometime you wont have a good life without enjoying it . Lastly , doctors say it is not good for you to always stay on the computer . One important fact is that you always need to excersise instead of lamping around . Sometimes might happen to your eyes because your steading looking at the computer . You need to do healthy things to help your body .

Can you even imagine how difficult life would be without computers ? They are a daily tool that millions of people use positively . One way that people use computers positively is by using it to be informed by news , traffic , and weather . For example , say there are signs of a hurricane going to hit near their homes . they would know righ away just by clicking on the internet . Another example is if there was a shooting nearby . People would be we will aware of the facts by reading an article online .

One electronic that has been useful in so many ways to people are the computers . Many think to much time is spent on this , but then I think about how much it is benefiting . Computers can tell you pretty much anything you need to know , @ CAPS1 it is about same country , or how to solve a problem . @ CAPS2 , computers are so advanced were you can talk to friends who are faraway . Lastly computers is helping us giving very specific directions , rather than figuring out a map . Say you are doing a school project about a country . By typing in exactly what you need to know you can find your information in a heartbeat . @ CAPS1 it is population , density , languages , foods or holidays , computers are the easiest and most simple way to get this information .

Maybe even you plan on visiting this country , you are going to want to know about the place you will be spending your time . If you do plan on traveling to somewhere you have been researching , you can order your plane tickets right there online . You can figure out the routes you plan on taking , and this can help oprganize your trip . Another reason computers are benefiting so many people , is the feature of communicating with others , @ CAPS1 it is taking to a faraway friend or family , or you are bestfriend a couple streets over ; you probably still want to keep in touch with them . Computers are so advanced now , that they have webcams ; were you can visually see the person your contacting right into the computer . This is a more exciting way to talk to someone , especially if it is someone you do not see often that @ MONTH1 even live in another country , @ CAPS2 , most teenagers like to keep in touch pretty much every day . Usually kids like chatting on instant message just for the pleasure of talking to your friends . Finally , computers are benefiting us with knowing directions and routes . Like mentioned before , computers can give straight foward directions . This is esier to handle rather than useing a map while on the road . There are websites were all you have to do is type in your exact loocation and your exact destination and it will tell you specific roads and turns you need to take .

Computers have many benefits to society but it also have many negitive effects on people who use them . People are spending more time on computers and less than exercising , enjoying nature , and interacting with family and friends . First , people spend less time exercising . Most athletes have to stay fit and healthy to play in there sport . I am a wrestler and a baseball player but if I do not spend some time a day working out or staying active . I will be out of shape and weaker once my match or next game come along . I am sure olympic athletes work out and stay active daily so they can be stronger and faster than anybody else out there so I do not know why people sit at home on the computer all day . Second , people do not take the time to enjoy nature . Nature is one of the most beautiful things on this planet . Wether you hiking a mountain of a lake , nature is all around you . I personaly love to hunt and fish . I take the time every sumer , @ DATE1 , fall , and sometimes winter to go out , enjoy nature , and have fun , and so do many other people in the world . Everyone who sits at home on the computer can not enjoy this gift that we have been given . Third , people will not take the time to with family or friends . If you the computer all day ther you can not go out and be active with your friends , or go for a bike ride with you brother . If you are on the computer you on family friend time that could be being used as a fishing trip or a walk in the woods . If you do not spend time with your family because of something you are doing on the computer , then you just a person . You will not valueable thing that you have in life you r family and you @ CAPS2 always be able to make time them . Finally , @ CAPS2 people use computers more ? No , they @ CAPS2 not use computers more . Computers take time away from exercising , enjoying nature , and interacting with family and friends .

Usually your family either lives far away or in another state and you do not get to see them very often . that is why I think video chating on the computer is a good thing .

How would you react if you did not have the time to exercise , enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends ? we will some people do not notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer . No time to exercise ? What does that mean ? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people . No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like , which is , since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games , chatting with people , ect . They do not get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise . What about nature ? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature ? I know I do . Since time flys when people are on the computer , which sometimes they do not realize , they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature . we will @ CAPS1 ' ll do that sometimes , but the truth is when people say stuff like that , it does not help to motivate themselves , it is basically saying I will go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that does not happen I will just have to do it the next day . Odds are that the person saying that will not actually go for a walk they will thinks it is going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off . What ever happened to spending time with family and friends ? Oh I know , I know , all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer . people do not realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they do not even have time to sit down talk to their family , have fun , go out with friends to catch a movie or something . As you have heard , more and more people are using computers , which I believe has a negative effect on them because they do not have time for exercising , enjoying nature , talking with family and friends ect . All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff , and it is not a good thing .

When was the last time you saw a kid outside doing something active such as running or playing a sport ?

I know people say that where you are on be computer , you spend less time exercising , but the computers help you with you throwing skills . Hand ey coordination also applies for if you want to be a surgeon / doctor . You need to have steady hands . What we ready to do whatever is needed . See , they do have a positive effect . I think computers have a positive effect on people . They give people the ability to learn about anything they want on the internet . Say you want to be an engineer when you grow up , you might want to learn anything and everything you can to be successful later on in that carer . What about a doctor , you would want to know how many years of college and med school are required to get your medical degree . A computer helps you learn about those things . It can also teach you about tons of other things . Again , how could they not be positive . I think computers have a positive effect on people . Another thing they can do out of a hundred others is let you communicate with other people no matter how far away . Mail can so my where with enough , yes , but @ CAPS3 - mail is free and gets there in less than a minutes where mail can lake weeks to go far . For example , what if you came from another country . You would not want to lose touch with people you grew - up with . With a computer , you could use skype to see now new the person . Talking on the phone or mailing does not even compare to that . You could never lose touch ! Computers help people do all kinds of things . I conclusion , computers have a positive effect on people .

9015,1175,1,"Dear people , Computers have been here for not a very long time and everyday more people buy computers and everyday people use them . As they are used for entertainment , education , and talking with people faraway , they have had a negative effect on people . Let me explain . First of all , as people use computers in the beginning they enjoy it . They go on the @ CAPS1 , play games , and use it for work . But as they keep using it , they start to get addicted . People are addicted to computers because of the games and being able to go on the @ CAPS1 . In fact , @ PERCENT1 of all the people in this @ CAPS3 who owns a @ CAPS8 , is addicted to computers . That percentage is expected to grow to @ PERCENT2 in the next @ NUM1 years . Addiction to computers lead to serious issues . People have died because they spent too much time on the @ CAPS8 without eating and sleeping . In another newspaper not long ago , it stated that a student attending @ ORGANIZATION1 , was dropped out for doing so poorly during school . His parent found out that he was addicted to this game "" @ CAPS3 of @ CAPS4 . "" This game is right now the most played game on the @ CAPS8 in this @ CAPS3 . Studies state that @ CAPS8 addiction is almost as bad as smoking addiction . My second reason why @ CAPS8 has a negative effect on people is because of online bullying . People chat on @ CAPS5 , @ CAPS6 , @ CAPS7 , and email and people are bullied . A friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feeling . Online bullying is worse that inteacting bullying . that is because @ CAPS9 you say something on the @ CAPS8 , people do not know who you are . @ PERSON1 , a proffesor who recently did studies of online bullying says , "" Online bullying has become more severe than contact to contact bullying . People are threatened more and hear more bad words than interacting . "" The online bullying and harassment is going to get worse @ CAPS9 people do not stop . Also people can get arrested for what they write online . My final reason why computers have a negative effect on people is that people spend too much time on computers and do not exercise @ CAPS8 contribute about @ PERCENT3 to overweight people . On the @ CAPS8 , everything is much easier . Instead of mailing , you could e - mail . You can listen to music instead of walking up to the radio and turning it on . You could buy tickets , shop , talk with friends , and have fun just by sitting on a @ CAPS8 . But this is why people become overweight and obese . @ PERCENT4 of the people who use computers are obese or overweight . Peole spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying nature . In conclusion , computers have a negative effect on people and parents should control their child ' s time on the computers . Just because of a @ CAPS8 , many issues rise . So @ CAPS9 you think you are addicted , try to make a time schedule for your whole day . Use the @ CAPS8 for an hour a time and take rests before using it again . Addiction , online bullying , and becoming overweight is not the only problems of a @ CAPS8 , there are many more .",9.0,242,5.10321898402098,14.243243243243244,37,0.4583333333333333,6.0,1.6098484848484849,1.44621153405033,0.03409090909090909,37.0
9019,522,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , I have herad that you guys are deciding whether or not computers have a negative or positive impact on the society . In my opinion , I believe computers have a very negative impact not only to adults but mostly to students too . Computers in general can be distracting , very dangerous , and give people less time to excercise . Computers in total do not have a bad impact on people . Some people say computers are not distracting , we will I say they are . Computers have varies websites such as @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2 which can distract people from studying or even doing their homework . @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2 are websites where you can chat with friends and see peoples pictures . These websites can be very interupptive when trying to do something important . For example , I am one of the biggest slackers when it comes to doing homework or studying . If I had to choose between doing homework or chatting on @ CAPS1 , I would choose @ CAPS1 . But if you actually think about , are these websites benefitting anybody . Homework and studying can actually benefit you in doing better can benefit you in your studies and ferther on in your life . In total , I believe computers are a big distarction . When people go on the computer they go on without worrying a little bit . They do not know the danger behind it . These dangerous computer have people on it called online predators . Online predators sit on the computers basically all day trying to harm others . One website in specific that I herad was very harmful is myspace . This website is even more dangerous then @ CAPS1 or @ CAPS2 . Myspace is like @ CAPS1 in a way but very dangerous . For instance , my mom told me that one of her friends daughter had a myspace and became friends with a guy she did not know . Of course she did not worry because according to her he seemed a nice guy so she gave him her number . Good thing her mom saw it , otherwise something bad would happend . He ended up being an online predator . Lastly , computer can make people unhealthy . People who stare on computers non - stop can make them not exercise . For example , not playing sports such as soccer , vollyball , and tennis . This is very unhealthy for people in our society because they can become obese and unhealthy . This is why computers can make you not exercise . In conclusion , computers can have a very negative effect on people . It can be very distracting , dangerous , and unhealthy for not exercising . In total , computers cannot have a bad impact on people .",9.0,205,4.9132361135999885,13.53125,32,0.4723502304147466,6.0,1.6981566820276497,1.1714416385441488,0.02073732718894009,32.0

In @ CAPS4 opinion , I feel that this invention @ MONTH1 be is taking a negetive toll on society . I say this because now - a - days there are inappropriate websites that children should veiw , and it takes away time with family . But mainly because of the recent @ CAPS3 issue . Without a doubt , youngsters such as are expertly and a website , we will just do as we were told and on maybe we could find one by an accident . Who knows ?

Whenever @ CAPS4 brother and I got on the computer we will stay in the all day . But every we have been together much @ CAPS4 now and I feel that computers have a negetive effect on society is because of the recent @ CAPS3 I was called to the office one day to be informed that a crew on @ CAPS3 com had befriended me and they were using boys and girls for drugs and prostitution .

9023,1743,1,"Dear local newspaper , I beileve that using computers is a good idea and will help people . So many people all over the world have computers . Computers are good because they help kids learn , communicate with others , and help teach responsibility . Please just listen to what I have to say . First , I beileve that computers help kids learn . If you buy computer games like a cooking game you can learn how to cook . Even if you buy the @ PERSON1 you are still learning by taking care of them . There are so many good websites that you can go on like @ ORGANIZATION1 . People learn through playing new things and why not play with your favorite characters . Also , you can go on google and type in anything you want and it will give you the answer . You use a keyboard for all this so you also learn how to type . If your teacher gives you a homework assingment why not type it so you learn that skill . This is why computers are good for hearg kids learn . Secondly , you can communicate with others from around the word or just your friends . There is a thing called @ CAPS1 or @ ORGANIZATION2 . You use a webcam and talk to anyone you want . There are also websites you can go on too communicate with people from all around the world . It is pretty cool because you do not have to travel there to talk to them . All of this stuff teaches you how people are different and no one person is the same . Peoples language could be different or there personality . So many communicating things make computers even better . Lastly , using computers helps teach responsibility . Kids who use internet know that poeple need privacy and that comes with responsibility because you should know that . If someone dosen ' t want to be bothered then do not bother them that has to do with privacy . Also , you learn to be nice on computers . If you video chatted you should definitely know to be nice and not be rude . That is how you get kicked off of these things . Another thing is people learn to take care of things a computer is worth a lot of money . Not everyone has one so you should be thankful for what you have . do not brag , but just know you are privleged for a computer . These things are the reasons computers are good . So if you ever consider getting a computer the answer is yes because computers help kids learn , you can communicate with others , and you learn responsibility .

Like spending less time with your family , getting addicted , and unhealthy . People who spend all there time on the computer forget that there family is there . For instance , I remember when I was little and I was on the computer and I forgot that i had family members with me , so I missed out on all the fun things like going to the mall or park . Certainly , playing on the computer is fun but woudn ' t you want to give some attention to your family .

I would , we need computer for many things , for example we need computer for communications , we also need them to educate yourself and others . Next this is good for buyers and sellers . My first reason why I agree that computers benifits society is because of the communications . Now in our present day with all of our new technology many people use computers to communicate with friends or family . For example if you had a loved one in the military you could use the computer to communicate with him with a webcam . Computer could be a good way to talk and ask friends about homework assignments you @ MONTH1 have missed as if you was absent . Also you could use computers to communicate with somebody selling something you @ MONTH1 be or , you could get more detail about that product by talking to the owner of it through maybe email .

For some students instead of study in classroom all day they could be learning from computers and it could be more to the students so maybe they would understand topics better . like science for example when doing a lab you could research and do it on a computer . With computers students could learn more because they would have textbooks or maybe nothing and if they were interested in a topic they could research it and educate themselves . My third reason would be buying and selling products . Many people all over the world go on the internet to buy or sell products . Like ebay that is a website many people items on to make money and other people can buy them . So computers could be a good solution to making money and to also saving gas because people can order products online and have them shipped to there house instead of driving @ CAPS1 from the I have told you like communications , education , and buying and selling products I hope you agree with me that computers do benifit society .",9.0,168,3.8877560748213034,21.764705882352942,17,0.4528301886792453,6.0,1.633423180592992,1.2607717938967942,0.01078167115902965,17.0

Yes , people would rather be a couch potatoe and chat online , eating a bug of a million junk food chips instead of going out and interacting while slaying fit , but now it is important that you do . Just picture lazy , obese . People sitting on their couch all day with their eyes blood from stearing at the monitor for hours . But why do you than you @ MONTH1 ask , it is because they never some outside . They never go for a jog or eat healthy foods . That is very unhealthy and can higher your chances of getting different cancers . Just ask @ PERSON2 from the hospital , "" @ DATE1 one guy was rushed to the hospital because of a very common cancer that you get from unhealthy living , he passed away @ NUM2 days later . It was very sad . "" I strongly believe that being on the computer to long is a very bad idea . It can ruin you eye - sight , you never get to see nature and interact .

Computers are wonderful they are great ways to find information , they connect people from all over the world , and offer many @ ORGANIZATION1 opportunities , hopefully at the end of this letter you will agree with me . Firstly , they help people find information . Computers are great ways to find information with google and other programs like it the whole world is at your fingertips . In my school surveys show @ PERCENT1 of all students use the computer to help them research for school projects and asignments with computers you can view many diffrent websites from all around the world about a topic and you can even find online books that you can use , this is one way computers are a great thing out there are two other great reasons . Secondly , with computers the wole world becomes smaller as people begin to know more and more people through the computer . More than @ PERCENT2 of people email , @ CAPS2 , or videochat on a daily baes . is not it great when you mnake a great friend in collage but you find out he / she lives halfway around the world , to know that you can still keep in touch with the computer , did you know that many people in the in the military use videochat to keep in touch with their loved one back home ? Computers are great because they connect people and allow them to be together even when they cannot be together , but there is still one even better reason why computers are good . Finally , computers ofter many opportunities like education and jobs . Today there are many single parrents more than in any other time according to @ ORGANIZATION1 and the number is still drastickly increasing with this economy some of those parrents could really use a better education to help them bring in more money for their familys , but when can they find time to go to school with work and then the kids ? Now there are many online collage courses you can take to get the education you have always wanted with kraigslist and other online adds many people can post job ofering while others can email those people their resume to try to get the job , but by seeing adds posted online people can apply easier from farther away . Computers open many great oppertunities for people .

Some of the awsome games featured on a computer are @ CAPS1 , cards , pinball and other great game . The computer makes for a happier home because as soon as kids get home from school they use it for games or chat with freinds . Another reason computers benifit society is because you can now pay bills and buy hings from the internet . When you pay bills or buy things over the internet have is no need to go out and waste money on gas so it makes people very happy when hey save money . It also saves on polution because if a car is not going out there is less so computers are also saving society as we will . My last reason that computers benifit society is they can make you smarter and make you do better in school by learning about often people or cultures . For example on my last research project for social studies I used the computer and got an A . this made me happy so in effect it makes society happy .

You do not need to do that . You can use a phone instead and call them . After a study they proved that talking on a phone is cheaper then using the computer . In this economy why would not you want to save money while getting the same thing also on a computer you do not really talk to the person you are really just typing word to them . This can be very dangerous . Who know if the person talking to you is really the person you think . Why take the risk when you can just use a phone ! Using the computer is like smoking . It is very addicting ! People stay on computers for hours every day and do not get exercize . If you just sit there moving your hand you are not really burning calories . This is a huge problem !

9040,239,1,"I personally think that people should not spend so much time on the computer . One reason why people should not spend so much time on the computer is because people spend to much time on them and not enough time exercising . Another reason why is because people are not enjoying nature . Finally , my last reason is because people are spending less time interacting with family ans friends . My first reason why people should not spend so much time on the computer is bacause they are spenfing more time on them then exercising . People will end up getting fat if all they do is sit around on their computer . People should be running or going to the gym instead of going on the computer . Even if you have your own equipment at your house to exercis on it is still better then going on the computer and not getting any exercise at all . If people spent as much time exercising then they spend on the computer , then the average weight of a human will go way down . Another reason people should ' t spend so much time on the computer is because people are spending less time enjoying nature . People should be outside getting fresh air instead of being inside on the computer all day . I personally would way rather be outside playing baseball and getting fit then being inside on the computer getting fat . Even if you look at nature via comuter , it still wan ' t be the same because you actually are not outside experiencing it yourself . If people waould spend as much time enjoying nature as they are on the computer . We would be living in a much more healthy and clean word . My last reason why I think people spend so much time on the computer is because they are spending less time interacting with family and friends . People could be in a dark room all day , isolated from everyone they came about just because they are on the computer . That to me just is not right because they covered he spending quality time with their friends and family , instead they are spending time with their computer . If a person spends all their time on the computer then everyone they care about will gradually be slipping away even if they do not know it . So as you can see , it would be much better if people spend more time exercising , enjoying nature , and interacting with family and friends then spending more time on the computer . even if you do not spend alot of your time on the computer yet , you will gradually spend more and more time on it everyday until eventually it is all you do .",9.0,146,4.326102368087924,21.38095238095238,21,0.3244444444444444,6.0,1.606666666666667,0.9587118829771318,0.011111111111111113,21.0

People do not even realize that computers can take away very important things in life . Fore istance , people are not getting nearly as much exercise as they need . In this generation , more kids are overweight and obese that any other other generation .

Next thing you know , you have a @ CAPS1 or @ CAPS2 on an assignment that the thought you aced . On top of getting false information , most people do not even know where to look to get the information that they are looking for . People just type what they are looking for into the google search box and press enter . Then they just click on the first link that they see and use the information that is right on the page . Then all of these different windows are popping up and you are far from where you were . People then just give up and start goofing off on the computer because they do not feel like trying to get back to that page . If people just went to the library and did research the old fashion way , then they would stop to notice all the things in life that they are missing out on . People should be focusing on family and friends rather than playing games on the computer . Sure you can talk to people on the computer but you can not bond with them or really see what they are feeling . it is better to invite them over and have some fun playing board games or just talking in person for a change . Even if your spending time with your family or friends you are probebly thinking about the computer the whole time that they are there , so go out and do something for change , a little fresh air would not kill you . You should go to an amusement park , ride some rides with your cousins , do something that will keep your mind off the computer . People do not realize it , but after spending so much time with your family , rather than your computer , you will acually notice what you have been missing out on for so long . As you can see , computers are not helping anyone . it is either not exercing , getting false information , or not spending time with your own family ! Seems to me that having computers around is not everything that it is cracked up to be .",9.0,257,4.969105917158885,19.228571428571428,35,0.3813056379821959,5.0,1.5133531157270033,1.3199465438337048,0.010385756676557865,35.0

Computers could be used to make new friends too , "" but their is people you do not know and we are not surpose to give out our information . "" said @ PERSON1 our health teacher .

Exercising is an easy thing to do , children likes to exercise so their sould not be a problem , like my nabor alway come over to my house and ask if I want to play football while I was talking with someone on the computers but I still went outside and play , so computer is a great machine that is not very addictive so parents does not have to worry about children exercising .

Second , the help people talk to friends and family using @ CAPS2 . Lastly they help people become less stressed by playing computers games . Learning is important and with computers , you are able to learn faster . Computers help you learn about faraway places like @ LOCATION1 . It is much easier to learn on the computer than to go to the library and check out a book . If you are working on a project and you needed some last minute information , you could just go to the computer and search you are topic . Learning on a computer is much more convenvent then going to the @ CAPS1 . Another reason computers are good is because you can talk to friends and family who are far away using something called @ CAPS2 . @ CAPS2 allows someone to talk to another person using the computer . These people could live just down the block or half - way accrose the world . My cousin is living in spain for a semester in college . I had skped with her many times . The cool thing about @ CAPS2 is that you can acctually see the person you are talking to on the computer screen . @ CAPS2 is a great way to keep in touch with family and friends who are faraway . My last reason is that computers help lower your stress level by playing games . Computer games are alot of fun to play . They have games that range from @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 the word , to @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 beauty barn . Computer games are a great way to lower your stress because instead of piking your self up with to much work , you will be calming your selfdown with computer games . They also gave educational games . like , Which country is which . This game teaches you geoagrahy while you have fun . Computers are a great thing to have .

I ' d much rather spend time outside where I can excercise ; @ CAPS3 ' t you ? Computers are a waste of time and they keep family and friends from spending time together . Finally , computers can be very dangerous . People could be lying and you @ CAPS3 ' t know it . To start off , computers take away from excercising and spending time outside . I know if I had to choose between looking at a boring computer screen all day and going out for a run ; I ' d choose the run anyday . Computers do not keep people fit and healthy so they should find something else to do instead . I had observed that the average teen spends @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 hours a day on the computer . that is @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 hours they could be excercising or playing outside . For example , walking the dog , or kicking the soccer ball around . You see , there are many things you can do other than going on the computer . Further more , computers cut into quality time with friends and family . I know you can video chat and instent message them , but @ CAPS3 ' t you rather spend time with them in person ? Too many kids are on the computer so much they do not know what is going on in their mom or dads lives . Theres is a lot of things kids can do with their friends and families instead of using the computer . They could play a board game , watch a movie , and much more . I garentee they will enjoy these activities more then staring at a computer screen for @ NUM5 hours . Finally , computers are extremly dangerous . People have been killed because they do not know who they are talking to . Kids go on myspace and put up pictures and posts , but they do not realize that everyone can see what they said . Once they put something out there they cannot take it away . it is also dangerous because it someone is applying to a school that school can see what they put up and can decline the person from college . I hope you agree with me when I say computers are bad . They keep people from excercising , spending time with friends / family , and are very dangerous .

It first starts off with grades . The parents tell their kid go and start your paper . They sayd ok , and then they are down there on facebook . More @ CAPS1 then not kids and parents abuse the computer . In fact @ PERCENT2 of america do uses it , that might seem like a small percent but that is more than half the country . Me I do not abuse the computer be I need to keep @ CAPS6 grades up . Most students have @ CAPS2 - average because studies show it is because of computers . Also if your son has a lapttop they are not doing work if that is what you think . I have computers , but we have , books for a reason , no spank , pop ups , or no distractions while working . Like one time I was working on a project , a pop - up came up and read trafic rush free to your computer . So dume me downloads it and @ CAPS6 parents caught me playing . Has this changed your mind .

9067,486,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 much do computers affect our life ? I have always thought of that question . Technology is getting up to the roof and it makes our life more easier , but have you ever thought that maybe technology might take people ' s work ? In everyday of our live we see something new that comes out and becomes an easy tool for us . But what about us ? Since technology come out people has become not the same ; for example cars , by having them people does not walk and not even exersice , they do not spend too much time with their family and friends and lastly people miss thousands of wonderful things that happend outside . I just think that technology like computers take a whole quater of our life by mostly doing the work for us . First , have you ever , notice that people get obiese so fast ? I know the answer to that question . The obesitity in @ LOCATION1 is getting worst , people are getting fattier by just been in a cautch and sitting with a computer and eating , what exersise are they doing there ? People does not exersise anymore , instead of them playing games like , soccer , volley - ball , baseball or even running , @ CAPS3 ! They are at the computer playing games that does not do anything good . I have asked people about what they think about this and this is what a woman answer , "" I htink that people does not think about their health , they just think to make life easier "" . I agree with her ; obisitty could bring you to the hospital and you do not want that . Second , have you ever asked your self about @ CAPS2 much time you ever spend with friends and family ? we will think of that . Maybe you got a computer because you were spending too much time outside bu not with your family , but you can see that you are probably most of the time at home since you bought your computer , but not with your family . Spending time with your family is so important because you might miss so many wonderful things . For example family parties , or just watching a show on the t . v . I just think that spending time with your family is important . Lastly , if you are a parent and you are too much in a computer , will not you feel bad if something happend with your son / daughter ? In everyway we always miss wonderful things , and sometimes we loose it because of technology , you do not want that right ? Imagen you are at the computer and your daughter said her first word will not you feel bad if you missed that ? I would . Always give time to life because maybe one day you might hate your self for missing so many wonderful things . In conclusion , so many people have become addicted to computers , they just can not lieve it alone . Imagen that you become one of them . You becoming obise , not spending time with family and missing wonderful things that the world provides us .

9069,686,1,"Dear local newspaper , I would like to speak upon the topic of the effects that computers have on people . My opion on this topic is that computers do have an effect on people . Most people while surfing the internet do not keep track of time . What I mean when I say most people lose track of time is that , they try to keep track of the time but while on the web something @ MONTH1 pop that catches their intrest and at that same time there focus is on something else . Some of the other effects computers can have on people is keeping them in the house . When many people are on the web they tend not to excersise as much . When in the house on the web most people that excersise stop excersising . The reason why this occurs is because while people are on the computer chair you feel so relaxed and calm that you do not want to get up . This leads into eating unhealthy foods . Some such as chips , donuts , twinkies and etc . Some @ CAPS1 do not believe that is an opinion . The reason I say this is because while watching television the other day I saw a commercial that said quote "" @ CAPS2 that are more active are healthier than @ CAPS2 that stay on the computer all day . Most @ CAPS1 do gain weight on the computer because they are not physically active . Not being physically active can lead to A ) obesity @ CAPS4 ) cloged arteries or @ CAPS5 ) lazyness . It can lead to all three because those are the effects of being on a computer every of the day . Most @ CAPS1 should be enjoying nature instead of staying on the computer . There is a lot more to life than being on the web . Some such as playing sports . Not only is playing sports fun but at the same tim it is also healthy . Would you rather live to @ NUM1 or live to @ NUM2 . And so local newspaper that is why I am writing you this letter today . I mean would you rather have friends @ CAPS2 or be lonely . There are weight surgerys but those can rack up to thousands of dollars . And yes weight loss surgery does have effects such as death .

In a survey taken in @ CAPS2 magazines @ CAPS1 should that @ PERCENT1 of people , have negative effects with computers . Inmy opinion , I think comuters have a negative effect on people . First , people are not interacting with family and friends . @ CAPS1 is very important to have interactions with people . When on the computer your not really interacting with . You just sit there staring at a screen . In a survey taken at @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 should that @ PERCENT2 of people are on computer and not interacting with the people around them . Parents do not se etheir kids as much because they are always on the computer . Parents would love to see their kids move . Interacting with their family and friends will be healthy to them . Computers take the away fromhanging out with family and friend . Secondly , people do not get to enjoy nature . People on computer might go outside because they are involved with the computer . Stay in one room doing the thing for books for a @ CAPS5 in a while people need fresh air . too but learning about nature is more nature . If you do not enjoy nature you do not know what is going on . NAture is all around us and why would you miss out on . in a survey taken in a local magazine @ CAPS1 should that @ PERCENT2 of people are on computer and . While people enjoy computer , nature . Lastly , people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising . Exercise is important for the mind and body . Our bodies need to stay healthy and fit . The lack of exercise is increasing fast . The more people get computers the people exercise . America is over weight already to join the People on computers most just long to become over weight . People rather play on computer that got exercise for a healthy body . Dr . @ DR1 a local doctor , has seen more people become over weight and not exercise as much as they used to . He says computers do not provide exercise . He recommends that people use their computers less computers are doing more . In conclusion , I think computer negative effect on .

Computers are wonderful and let us do so many things that we can not do by ourselves . Without computers life as we know it would probably be way different . Firstly , computers let us talk to our friends and family . Allowing us to communicate to one another without us leaving the safety of our homes . See , just recently a girl in @ CAPS1 went over her friends ' home to do their homework together . When they were done the girl tried to walk home , and she was never seen again . With computers we can do homework with our friends without leaving our homes . Clearly , without computers life as we know it would be way different .

Allowing us to do projects without having to look in old books that maybe not have the info . you are looking for if it was to search @ ORGANIZATION1 it would give me a map pointing out it is location and the schools website where I can find out my homework for that night .

Without a doubt , without computers life as we know it would probably be way different @ CAPS2 , Computers allow us to do homework on it wether it is research or just typing something up , it lets us do more capable things .

It is proven that people too to fifteen years old spend an average of @ NUM1 - @ NUM2 hours of their free time on a computer . People age sixteen to forty - eight spend @ NUM1 - @ NUM4 hours of free time daily on their computer . Too much time on the computer can interfere with physical activities , social time , and health issues . Computers have some good advantages here and there but mostly result in a negative effect . In this post decade , the percentage of exercise was gone down and computer bills have gone up . Americans have now spent most of the time web surfing , playing online games , and interacting with online chat rooms . After school , kids go home and turn their computer on instead of going outside running and playing . More people across the country have gained weight due to unhealthy food and no physical exercise . Many local sports have lost teammates due to lack of desire for physical activities because of computers . Many people have stopped going out with friends and family due to going on the computer . The that runs through @ CAPS1 minds these days is ' why go out to talk to my friends , when I can talk them online ? ' I think the opposite . Get out of the gloomy house and go out to see my friends . I do not even go online within every days . I check online for homework and in online shopping twenty minutes . Computers have a major effect on social lives like going out and being confident to meet new people . Lastly , health issues are raising rapidly ! The reason we now have shows on @ CAPS2 about people with weight and health problems can relate very much so back to the negative effect on people . Like @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 , and the obese have shown how people gain weight . I think at least @ PERCENT1 of these people spend to much time on the computer and not exercising . Eating @ PERSON1 ' s then goint home to play online games will definately increase health issues like weight , organs being unhealthy , muscles not functioning properly , and eye and brain damage from starring at a mouse and screen nonstop .

Computers have now become part of our society and culture and is very important by following reasons . One computers let you surf online anytime you want . Two , computers allow people talk online . First reason why computers are so critical in our culture is that computers let you surf online anywhere and anytime you want . This is very convenient . What if you live far away from the nearest library ? When you have to write a research paper ? Jane lives @ NUM1 miles away from her town library . Her mother could drive her ther , but what if she was not at home or driving someone else to a doctor ' s appointment ? This is when computers come in handy . Jane can just simply go online and do the research !

Also , you can video chat with your lab partner to discuss how you can make the lab report better ! @ PERSON1 , the author of "" @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 "" also states in his book that over @ NUM3 million people use internet to videochat for educational purposes .

Some say that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and spending time their family . Although , "" The @ DATE1 survey of what people do , "" states that @ PERCENT1 of people who use computers are healthy both physically and emotionally .

Reason two is that they can be great knowledg for people . @ CAPS1 third reason that computers are good for people is that there are many programs that are team based and help people with teamworks and team building skills . Those are three of the many reasons why I think that computers are good for people and have had a positive effect . First of all , I think that computers are good for people because they help keep friends connected . If you move to another town , go to a colledge far away , or move because of a job you will most likely , if @ CAPS5 is further away , loose connection with you friends . But , using a computer can solve that problem . In social networking sites like @ CAPS3 , twitter and myspace you can simpily look up your distant friends from you previoulsy lived and have contact with them . Youi can catch up with each other , recall good times you have had , end maybe make plans to meet each other sometime . @ PERCENT1 of @ CAPS2 have been reconnected using social networking site on a computer . Experts also say that @ CAPS5 is important to stay connected with your past to sustain a we will being and to be happier . I have had an experience when a scoial networking site has reconnected me with a @ CAPS2 . When i was younger I had a @ CAPS2 who is grandmother lived to @ CAPS1 dad . After a little over a year of him being good friends be moves to @ LOCATION1 , I thought I would never hear from him again . Later that year I also moved to a different town , @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 searched me on @ CAPS3 and we got connected again , I have found out he moved back to where I use to live . That is the first reason I think that computers are @ CAPS4 good for people . The second reason , @ CAPS5 is that computers can be great knowledge scources for people . If you ever need to set information that not have to through the of book , then , a computer is the thing for you . As long as you than to find an accurate and reliable scourse than a computer . Is an amazing tool . You can look up almost anything and you will be able to find locks of information on @ CAPS5 . Statistics show that you can find @ PERCENT2 more information on a computer than a book . Experts have stated that soon books will be obsolite and computer will rain as knowledge scources . That is the second reason why I think computers are good for people . Last of all , I think that computers are good for people because there are many programs that help with teamwork and team buildings skills . What I by programs is yes of course videogames . Almost all of the computer games out have multiplayer features . Withins the multiplayer universe there are match types that involve a great amount of teamwork . In the age games you must communicate and talk to your team if you want to win . And that is the only way you will win is by using teamwork . That is @ CAPS1 third reason why I think computers are good for people .

Also we can learn about faraway places like @ LOCATION2 or @ LOCATION1 . My mom always says , "" @ CAPS1 your room or @ CAPS2 going to give your stuff to people in need . "" @ CAPS3 the first time she said that to me I went to the computer to see how other people were having to me . Some were good , nice , big houses but tyen others lived in boxes and trash cans . That changed me big time , I felt really had for those people . Lastly computers help people make money and support their family . @ PERCENT2 of all people found out about their job on a computer . Theycan go to websites to find good safe jobs that makes good money . Plus if you have a computer you can easily work from home . Some people do not have the money for babysitters so have to watch their kids all day so have to work from home to make money . Finally people can apply for jobs or even community service online . My sister , @ PERSON1 , got her first job by going on the @ CAPS4 museums website and applying right there on the computer . Therefore computers are good . I say this because people can interact with other people online , people can research useful information , and finally computers help people find jobs and make money . Do you use computers for any of these reasons ?",9.0,207,4.842112406329055,13.40625,32,0.4813953488372093,6.0,1.555813953488372,1.4197367178034823,0.02558139534883721,32.0

Computers are also a good form of entertianment . Those are some of the reasons computers are helpfull . First , computers can help find out how to do things . If there is evey somewhere far to go or there are many winding roads to get there you can use the computer . On the computer there are many maps that give detialed discriptions on how to get places . Specialist say that over @ PERCENT1 veiwers get to their destianation . The due to lack of driving skills . Computers also help with instructions on how to make things . If there is a cake to be made the computer will have recipies to make @ CAPS2 . That also can help make projects . For example They show things about @ CAPS3 mythology for making a @ CAPS3 pat . The computer can help you , learn langues . There is software that can teach people languages just like books execpt that they have animated teachers to help speak the languege that one got directions to go to . Reading all the did not langues can help you with normal reading . Another reason that computers are helpful is they can help people with reading . Did you know that @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 americans have trouble reading . That would not happen if they had computers . Almost everything on the computer has to be read so @ CAPS2 gives a lot of practices . @ CAPS2 also will improve hand eye corodination . When someone something they watch the screen not their hand . Also on microcoft word to type an essay you watch the screen not your fingers typing . There are many games on the computer for improving hand eye corrdination . The last reason that computers affect people is that they are enteritaining . One the internet there are many fun games for all ages . Some games they could watch videos one youtube there are many funny videos there . As you can see computers are helpfull in many ways .

The technology has many great things about it , but theres also a huge down fall . The most common technolgy device is the computer , it is a great thing to have but it is also very bad . The computer can be used to bully , it can take time from exercising and it even takes from your social and grammer skills . We all know the websites such as facebook , myspace and @ CAPS1 . They sseem harmless but it is really just a place for harassment . Their said to keep friends in touch , butkids use them to say hurtful things about each other . Half the kids in my eighth grede class have admitted to either getting bullied or bulling over the computer . If so many kids are getting hurt by the then why do we all keep using computers ? Many kids @ MONTH1 say they do not spend to much time on their computers but @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 kids in my school admit that they do . Checking the computer is the first thing they do when they get home from school and the last thing hey do before going to sleep at night . All the time these kids spend on the computer is taking away from exercising and enjoying life as a child . I had seen many kids gain exessive amount of weight because they do not eat proper food they do not exercise and they shut down from reality all because they are obsessed with their computers . kids are even getting portable computers , that is how addicted they are . Do you want your kids like that ? However , all these programs and websites that are on computers have a way to inneract with friends , and socialize . But all of this is taking away from your social skills , even grammer . Most kids and teenagers would rather talk over the internet thant face to face , and half the time they do not even spell word correct or use proper grammer . In the long run all this talking over computers is going to hurt them when it comes to school and getting a job . I know that computers are good for school because you can research stuff for projects and e - mail your job . But the time spent , kids getting bullied , and the now lack of social skills is not worth it . We need to cutback on our societys use of computers because it will help us all when it really counts . Just ask yourself do you want your kids getting bullied ? Do you want to gain weight ? Do you want to loose your social and grammer skill ? Just ask yourself these questions and you just might change your mind .",9.0,221,4.64491657954358,17.592592592592588,27,0.4642857142857143,5.0,1.4705882352941178,1.2538013905715866,0.023109243697478996,27.0

9087,1659,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , I am here to talk about my view on computers , about how they help people , and how many people say that kids and adults are spending to much time on them . My first views on this subject is that computers are becoming more and more advanced as time goes on . These past few years , computer company ' s have been making enormous strides allowing people to do allmost everything . This is both good and bad . A computer is a tool that is a good feature for any home . It is great for people who own a small business , you can easily go online and update somthing yoou want changed in your store , such as designing colorful posters to put on the windows of your store to increase business and to catch peoples eye . You are also able to book flights weeks or even months before you even go to the airfort . This is good for those who are busy and travel a lot . You can go on a website called @ ORGANIZATION2 where you can go anywhere vin the world and zoom in on a landmark such as the great @ CAPS1 in @ LOCATION2 , or the @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 in @ LOCATION1 . Computers can also improve your hand eye coordination when you type . Typing is a important skill to master , if you are a good typer you can do things much more efficient then you would on paper . Some can even memorize the key board and not have to even look down . Computers are also great for communication if you have relatives far away in another state or even country you can easily talk to them through @ CAPS4 . @ CAPS4 is a online service that you use to talk to them in person . These are just some of the things you can do with computer . On the other hand many say that people are spending to much time on computers , and getting outside for execise and not spending enough time with family . I do agree this is the case in some ways . I know some friends who average about six hours a day on computers which to me is to much , also parents become to busy with work that they are on computers , when they should be spending time with their kids . Some kids became so addicted to computers that they might become unhealthy and become obease from sitting so much , this is something that should not happen . I hope you have learned a little bit about the good and the bad about computers , and how it is important not to be on the computer to much , but it can be an important feature if used correctly .",9.0,207,4.142418363543064,22.15,20,0.4662162162162162,5.0,1.5743243243243243,1.1883763717345075,0.03153153153153153,20.0

People of our society are spending to much time on computers , and not enough time exersizing and interacting with family and friends . By starting now we can make a difference in the lives of thousands . First off I would like to say that it is imporitive that we exersize daily . If we do not fit exersizing into our day to day schedual , we are potentally putting our health on the line . Activities such as taking a dog for a walk , riding a bike , or taking a nice jog through the park are just a few ways to help your physical fitness . Also taking part in extracuricular activities can play a major part in exersize . This not only helps physically , but it helps mentally too . Finnally another method of exersizing is to play a part in your local community service projects . Exersizing every day is just one way to keep you active and off the computer . Lastly , interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer . Playing games is one way that can help you stay connected with your family . This can bring you closer to the people you love , and help them get to know you a little better . Furthermore you can play with your friends , and in the process develops social skills . Who knows developing social skills could help you in the future . Plus , by interacting with family and friends you can learn to be relaxed and let your life take it is natural source . This is another helpful technique that can improve the quality of your life and keep you from the temptation of being on the computer . In conclusion techniques like exersizing and interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer .

9089,423,1,"Dear Newspaper @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 people in our community use computers for positive ideas . Such as if gives you hadn and eye coordination , gives people the ability to research on far away places and allows you to talk to far away family . This is why I think computers have a positive effect on people . To begin with computers give a positive efect on people because it gives you hand and eye cordination . For example that can help you to have ability to do more . Like work somewhere such as a restraunt . This needs lots of cordination for holding heavy trays . My mom is a waitress and she needs a lot of cordination she tells me . Another reason would be you would have more hand cordination driving because you can react fast . Some people say that computers make you not be able to see while . Which than you would need glasses . But that is there desision this can give you one reason that computers are a positive effect on people today . Secondly why computers are a positive effect because it gives people the ability to search far away places . Why this can be a good thing is because you can get a good idea of what it is like and might want to take a trip there . Another reason would be that students usually have projects which call for research in other countries . Computers make kids smarter that way but some people say that kids could get on a website where it can be bad , which also they arn ' t getting exersize if all there doing is researching when they can do that in the own town . But about @ PERCENT1 of kids can stil be on the computer than go and get exersize . This is another reason computers are an impact . Lastly , why computers are positive is kids and adults can talk to there friends or family quicker . For exmaple if a family member lives far away instead of mail you can send it on the computer in a @ NUM1 minute send . it is quicker and easier . Another reason is your kids will be able to talk to there friends faster than mail as we will . About @ PERCENT2 of kids use computers to talk to there friends But some people say kids can think there talking to there friends but could be someone bad . But to make sure all your friends should have one question to make sure it is there friend . This is why to computers are a positive impact on young adults , and children , parents . To conclude , I would like to say that computers are a positive impact for a couple reasons one it gives you more hand and eye coordination gives people the ability to search other countries and beable to talk to friends . Others disagree because it can ruin your eyes , not get exersize and lastly give your child unsafe . But that can be changed easily by limiting kids , see who they talk to and get them in a sport .

9091,251,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 I have learned that some experts say that people spend too much time on computers when they could be excercising or with friends and family . I , on the other hand , think otherwise . Computers are a great way to learn and communicate with others , here ' s why : @ CAPS3 of all , I would like to say how much computers help us in school . Most students use them every day . We can study for tests by looking for websites with lots of information and we can also research topics that we do not understand . For example , if you want to find out how planets form , you can just type it into a search engine and a list of websites will pop up . Another way we use computers in school is when we have to make projects . We can use different tools to set up a slide show while also looking up information on the internet . Lastly , the internet is also a way for teachers to communicate with their students . If the teacher sets up a blog , students can always see what the class is doing , what the homework is , and find cool links that will help them understand certain topics better . Another point I would like to mention is that the experts say that computers deprive us of time with family and friends when the truth is , it is the opposite , computers actually take communication to a whole new level . For example , if you wanted to have a chat with an old friend , you could log right on to msn or aim and find out what is new in their lives . A second way to communicate with friend is by @ ORGANIZATION1 , a cheap and easy way to contact friends outside the country . Next , you could go a bit more old fashioned and just write an e - mail . It will take longer to get a reply but it is still worth the wait in the end . Lastly for parents who kids live far away , video chat is also a good way to communicate because you will be able to see them and hear their voice as we will . Lastly , I would like to tell you about just how much we can learn by using a computer . You could just go to a search engine and search any topic in the world and you are bound to finds hundreds of results . It does not matter what your interests are because you will always find great information . The internet also allows you to catch up on recent news such as weather . Next , there are websites that allows you to ask questions and get answers just as fast . You might have to check your sources to make sure they are reliable , but I believe it is still worth it . Lastly , if you are getting ready to go on a trip , you can check flight information with the click of a button . Or maybe you need to find out what the weather will be like , there are many websites for that . There are also websites that can help you learn about the place you will be staying at as we will . Next time , think twice about what you hear about computers because they really are not all that bad for you .

This also helps because you can email someone interested of sending a letter in the mail , which costs money , unlike email . So the internet can also be a way of saving money . It is also much faster to send someone an email than a letter . The internet is a great way to keep intouch with friends and relatives . I also believe that the use of computer is more efficient than doing to a library and researching a book . If you do not have enough time to go the to a library , you can do some research at your house . What if the library is closed if you do go , then you wasted some time . The internet never closes , it is open @ NUM1 . What if you go to the library and they are open , but do hot have a book on your subject ? This can also be done on the internet because there is any thing you could ever ask for on the internet . If you have an over due library book you can renew the book on the internet . The internet is a great place research on any topic you have or doing what ever you want . Finally , the computer is great for playing about every game , there is that you would feel like playing . Also @ CAPS1 of spending about @ MONEY1 on an x - box and a game , you @ MONTH1 only have to spend about @ MONEY2 on a game that goes into your computer . There are also many websites that have games on them . Some websites are for specific games , and same have many games on them . Only a few of the games are interactive with other players and you can talk and make new friends . On the other hand , many games are only for one player . As a result , a computer is a great use to play games . In conclusion , I believe the computer is great need for our society . In the long run it will pay off , especially with the economics problems our country is having now , by helping us save money , It will also allow connection with old friends , save time , and provide entertainment to all who would like .",9.0,204,4.828421387710193,15.612903225806454,31,0.4206185567010309,5.0,1.5484536082474227,1.3317607101149556,0.012371134020618556,31.0

The internet seally lets you see what is happening in or world because there are various news sources , and blogs on the internet , @ PERSON1 do you remember the earthquake in @ LOCATION4 we will I sure do , because I found it out on the internet . You can also find directions to places , sports stats and about different places . we will what is a better way to find out a bout those than talking with people who live there ? I do not think anything is , seriously is it better reading about @ LOCATION5 or talking to someone in @ LOCATION5 ? that is the beauty of the internet is it bonds the world together into a tighter realationship , I remember chatting with people from @ LOCATION3 while the gold medal game @ PERSON3 . Sure some people would say that you could meet someone in person from a different country , we will how would you meet someone from @ LOCATION2 in @ LOCATION1 , because I never have . People could say go to the place to talk to the person and , with the internet , it is very possible . Have you @ PERSON1 wanted to go to @ PERSON4 ? Well with the internet all you need is your credit card and you could be there tomorrow because the internet allows you to try new things . Have you ever wanted to try pingpong , it so you could or does a set offline and have it shipped to you in a couple of days , I always wanted to go to a zoo but , I did not know of any , so I used the internet and see school for zoos near @ LOCATION1 , @ LOCATION1 and before I could move the results for @ PERSON2 zoo were right infront of me .

People need computers to get updated on important issues , contact others and learn new information . Computers are neccisary for everyday life . it is very important that news gets around , and one way for it to do that is by computers . Average people like me and you need to know the weather , global issues and many other important topics . If you use the computer to get updated on important issues you will be able to acess the information right away . For example there is no need to wait for the weather to come on the television when you can find out the weather for your local area withen seconds . Just recently there was an earthquake in @ LOCATION1 and million of civilians died . if a natural disaster was to happen somewhere in @ CAPS2 people would need to know and computers are a great way to make sure everyone is updated . Not only does the computer help us get important updates on global issues but it is also a great way to contact people . My relatives live very far away and we can not afford the long distance phone call charge and so we e - mail them . @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 people contact far away friends and family by e - mail ! The computer is also a great place for friends to contact each other through social networking sites , such as @ CAPS3 , @ CAPS4 and @ CAPS5 . People need to interact with other people and the internet is a fantastic place to do that . Finally computers can also be used to learn new information . If children need to find inforamtion for a project or essay the can easily search the internet and find an answer . Kids need to acess the information that is neccisary for school on the internet . Computers are useful for adults as we will . If adults want to learn something new all they have to to is search it on the computer . it is so much easier than going out to the library and finding that information in a book . @ CAPS1 you know that most adults use an online dictionary to find the definition to a word ?

I also think this will help the problem because it will also allow you to get better grades . If your on computer all the time & do not have any time to excersise , go outside , and bond with your family then that most likely means you have no time to do homework .

9109,607,1,"Dear newspaper , I read an article in the newspaper that said how people on their computers is a benefit and could be a bad habit . I actually think it is a good idea about people being on their computers . I have a few reasons why this is a good thing . Whenever a student needs information on a certain topic , then they use the internet for help . Research is helpful because there could be a lot of sites on - line that could give you what you need . The topics typed into search engines will help find any information help to you . Whenever a teacher @ MONTH1 need an assignment typed , you can type it on your computer and have it ready the next day . You can also find interesting pictures on what you are learning about . Sometimes the internet could have more information than a certain book you would look into . It would sometimes be a good idea not to search for something all night , or someones going to be mad at the electricity bill . Also , it would be good if you double check your information because it could be fake . Using the internet does not need to be for work only . People use computers to shop on - line , check times for movies , and talk with friends . People talking to friends on - line is good because they @ MONTH1 not be able to talk however they want in school , and you @ MONTH1 not get to see them on the weekends . Teens who talk on - line usually talk with their best friends . If one friend on a group of friends probablly in the same town as you , then they could talk by using their laptops they bring anywhere . Then you could probably hear about something that you ( and your friends ) have in common which @ MONTH1 be coming somewhere that is by where you live . So being on the computer to talk with friends is not so bad . Students who are young , usually get to learn to type . This could help them in the future if you need to type up an assignment for school , a job application , or college application . Learning to type is good because you also get to see which keys are where and will not need to look at them alot . Soon , you would be able to type a certain amount of words in a short amount of time . This @ MONTH1 also be help with reading and understanding big words .

More teens would rather be on the computer than outside playing tag or on a swingset . I , myself , have an @ CAPS2 , facebook , and @ CAPS3 and it is prevented me from getting exercise becaose it is almost like i ' d rather be talking to my friends than going for a jog . It bothers me , it really does , but there is one question I always risk myself ; how do I stop ? I had been going on runs , studying more , and spending time with my family . There ' s ways and reasons to stop being so attached to technology , we just do not know how to get the message spread . Other than the affects social sites and exercise has had because of computers , online gaming is also a big issue too . Many kids , not mostly boys , to what I see at school are absolutely loving online gaming . But the only people that actually benefits in life are the website owners . These games are not educational , it is not a good why to spend a couple of hours of your time . So generally it is a waste . More important things should be done during this time like studying or doing homework . Just think , you could even hangout with friends doring that time rather than sharing on a monitor . Although computer gaming is a big reason why kids go on the computer , bullying is a huge factor along with stranger danger on chats . If , you are someone who is bullied constantly at school , you think being able to go home and spend time on the computer is amazing ; until bulling came along . Cyber bullying can lead to a child working themselves , getting fights at school or even worse , someone ' s like taken because they did not think it was worth living . Limited computer use or parental control would really help prevent this . Computer usage has it is ups and downs , but my point is safety , health , and education , one the main issues we face because of modern technology . I ' d like to hear that my letter to your newspaper was read . Please get back to me with your thoughts on this issue within the next three days by email .",9.0,244,4.557615298850182,19.08,25,0.5104602510460251,6.0,1.5690376569037656,1.1829661954675217,0.02092050209205021,25.0
9113,828,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , Computers have been an incredible help to many people as they advance in knowlege . But , many people do not think about the negative affects of computers . Computers make research easier to find , and they organize data we will and quickly . Computers make comunication easy , but there are many negative affects as we will as positive . Chat rooms on computers are a great way to communicate quickly , but they can also be dangerous . More and more kids are spending time on computers , rather than outside excersising and communicating with friends and family . Chat rooms are commonly used by kids as we will as adults . Kids use them to talk with friends , make plans , and catch up relatives . But kids are not the only people that use chat rooms . Adults use them too . Some for good , others for bad . Adults sometimes have chats for their work to talk with their fellow workers . They can communicate easily what has been done and what needs to be done at the office such as what bills have been paid . This is a good way for workers to know what is going on outside of the office . There , are many other useful advantages of computers . Some other advantages of computers are the computers functions . Computers are good for finding information quickly . Computers are useful to find information for school projects . Computers can also take that information , and organize it on graphs , and computer programs such as microsoft powerpoint . Other pluses about computers , are that they can teach hand - eye coordination . Typing can help majority with this . Typing is also another advantage . If people do not have great pendmanship , they can use a computer to type essays , homework , and school projects . This makes reading the assignment easier for the student as we will as the teacher . There are many advantages to computer , but there are also disadvantages . More and more kids are spending is their free time on the computer , instead of ouside exercising . This is causing kids to become less active . Being in a chat room all day is also a disadvantage . Kids today are using a new language in chat rooms as well as texting . They are using abrevations for words and phrases , such as "" idk "" for "" i do not know "" . This language is damaging how kids read and write . Although chat rooms on computer can be useful , they can do also be dangerous . Kids as well as adults go into chatrooms and talk to other people , saying invalid information about themselves . Such as age . Some adults go into chat rooms and pretend to be a teenager . They talk to kids until they find out something like an address , phone number , school , and district . Once they got information like that , they can find out many other things about kids . this is extremely dangerous and unfortunately , it does , and has happened . As you can see there are many advantages as well as disadvantages . I believe , if people can find a balance between them , people will agree more about computers . In my opinion computers are handy , but dangerous . If kids are more careful online , and spend more time outside than on the computer , there would be less controversy . Parents would be less concerned about their childs safety and health if kids only used computers for homework , and were safe about who they talk to online . Also , what kids say in profiles . If all of this happened , there would be a balance , and I think people would be less drasticly over a period of time , and people would be more comfortable .",9.0,234,5.359717350502639,13.177777777777774,45,0.3939393939393939,6.0,1.6936026936026936,1.4856140752888127,0.011784511784511785,45.0

This also revolves around addiction , by using the computer over a large period of time . In the end , computers are a harzardous topic , when it comes to working out , and staying in shape . Computers are terrible and horrified when it comes to friends . Friends are people who spend time with you and interact with you . But computers see it a different way . by using computer for a long period of time , you begin to think how computers are all you need .

These people are not necisarily bad , but they are under the control of technology . Computers for example , are in the eyes of most people , fast , easy and fun , but they also pose as a problem . Even though it seems like everybody has a computer , not everybody does . Also people become way to dependent on such matchines that they can become addicted to them . Computers @ MONTH1 also seem like they work @ PERCENT1 of the time , but they can also be very unrelyable .

My point is that , what if somthing important came up that required your friends help , and you could not reach him because of a fault in the system ?

People no longer go outside and play cowboys and @ CAPS7 because now all they have to do is hit paly .

Computers have an effect on people but in a negative way . People get adicted and distracted and can not get work done . Many inappropriate things are written in computers that children and adults should not read . Lastly people stare at a computer screen all day which can cause brain damage . Effects from computers can be very negative and not beneficial at all . With children at school and adults at jobs , there is most likely a lot of work to get done , but computers should make a person not get the work done . The other day in class the teacher was collecting homework , but @ NUM1 out of the @ NUM2 kids in our class did not have the homework . When the teacher asked why the kids did not do their homework , they said that they were on the computer and forgot about the homework . When the children and adults do not get their work done then grades could be dropped , or people could get fired . The effect is very harmful , and all this happened just because of the adiction and distraction of computers . Since some internet sources are very social , and not all people are kind , mean and inappropriate articles and language could be read . Many children do not know a lot of bad words and certainly no one wants them to be exposed to learning more , so why let them go on the computer and read about these bad things ? Adults @ MONTH1 know more about the harmful language , but why influence them to write the bad things or comment using mean tones . If adults and children are not exposed to these bad uses of language then our world could easily be made up of better and kinder people . Studies show that if a person stares at a computer screen for at least three hours a day , then in about two weeks time the person brain could be damaged .

Why because it has made us kids homework easier to do , and fun sites you can check out . Even for adults when they need to look up something important they can automatically find it in the computer . First reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is because it makes @ CAPS1 homework easier , instead of getting it from a book I can get it from @ CAPS1 computer . Trust me it is much easier than reading all those types of books when you have a computer . Then you can just type in what you want and it would automatically pop up for you .

Then you go to search and put in @ LOCATION1 then all this @ CAPS2 of him comes out . So you get the right information that is an easy A + for you . Second reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is all the sites you can go on and play games or go on youtube , or myspace . it is alot of things you can do on a computer to have some fun . For , example , say you don ' @ CAPS3 want to play your game or watch @ CAPS3 . V , or go outside . What do you do , get on your computer . So you can check your myspace page or watch funny videos or maybe talk to some of your friends online . Think about it , you can ' @ CAPS3 do none of those things on your @ CAPS3 . V or your game and especially not outside so that is why I think a computer has a positive effect on people . Lastly , I think the computer has a positive effect on people because even adults like to get on computers . Half of every adults job has an computer that they have to use either to cash a check on a computer or teachers to put in grades and scientist to look up different experiments . For example a teacher alway ' s have to use their computer to put in grades or see what us kids need help on or how far we got and how far behind we are . So it makes it easy on adults as we will .

A once job has become simple , with the mere click of a button it is nerve - wrecking that the majority of our day need not be filled with flooring errands , but what we want ! Whether that be to exercise or simply enjoy nature . In a nutshen , computers are great assets to society . They have a muriad of purposes and functions . They can inrease a person ' s knowledge of faraway places safely , be used for communication purposes . and make everyday tasks simple . it is hard to even ruminat how we managed before this device come along .",9.0,237,4.67237292074859,15.266666666666667,30,0.5163398692810458,6.0,1.7342047930283224,1.6874548350088157,0.04357298474945534,30.0

But , it is not good for you to just drop everything and go to your computer . Things like exercise , socializing and homework matter . If you do not exercise you begin to gain weight , if you do not socialize you will be an lonely person . Homework is the most important , because it will help you really we will through life . it is fine to go on the computer time to time , but not for hours . Exercising will keep you in shape and if you plan on playing sports , you should jog a couple times of day . Some people make you feel bad if your bigger than they are . For example , I knew someone who was a little big for his age , but people did not like him and they always made fun of him . I would suggest that you should keep your mind on more important things than a computer . Do you have ant friends ? Or did all of them leave you because you would not stop surfinh the web on your computer . As a teenager you should be socializing with your friend at the movies , arcaded and parties . Not in the house on the computer . Especially with your family , because you never know if they are going shopping for you ask me that is selfishness . Every since you got your computer have you been receiving bad grades ? Education is the most important thing you need in your life . Without it you can not be or do anthing , because you would not have a degree to get a job . If you do not have a job how can you pay for electrity bill for your computer ? Education can get anywhere , if you want it . If not you can be a homeless guy in the street holding a computer that does not work . Do you still think this has a positive effect on people ? You should talk to parents about getting their child an computer . For example , tell the parent to put a password that only she / he knows , that way he has to ask you to sign onto it everytime we needs it . Blocks off things that you think is important for your child . especially if your child is into sex .

9131,745,1,"Dear @ STATE1 ' s newspaper editors I have recently read an atical that was talking about how experts are concerned that people are spending way too much time on their computers . we will I agree with them . I strongly belive that computers are tacking time away from you exercising enjoying nature and even interacting with family and friends . we will if you look at teen ' s this day and how more and more are becauming over weight like back in the days when their was not computer or internet not as much people were over weight or even obiste because they had time to go out and exercis or play sports with othes . Exercising is importent because espeshaly when as a teen you are over weight or even obiste we will theis problems just do not go away this will cost you in the futer because not only do you have to chance of getting deobetice but you also have to pay for all the medications and treatments that comes with it . Experts also belives that by spending time on the computer will tack time away from enjoing the things that nature has to offer . When other might argue to it is a good thing for people to learn about the different types of place ' s in the world . we will I delive why do you have to just read about the places online and look of the picture why can not you be the one tacking the pictures for other to see . And why can not you be the one experincing it insted of just reading about it . Experts also believe that by spending time on the computer it is tacking away time from you being able to interacting with family members and friends . Well as a teen myself I have learned that by intercating with family and friends are vary important to our health . I am not the only person that agrees with that because study shows that kid that can talk to their perents and have good convercations with their parent have the ability to do well in school and have more respect towed others verces the the kid or teen that can not really have conversation or talk to their parents . For example if you are the type of person that talk to your family You will have good grades such as A ' s and @ CAPS1 ' s and will learn to have respect for other and the person that can not talk to their parents have troble concentrating or even macking troble fro themselfs and getting @ CAPS2 ' s and @ CAPS3 ' s .

Would you really try to prevent your child , friends , and families from using such an amazing invention that helps us every day ? The computer can help others communicate , help educate you , and even prepare you for the future . One great option that computers have is the option to communicate with others . You can set up an email or a chatting account to talk with friends and family . Now some people might think , "" @ CAPS1 not use a phone to talk to others . "" @ CAPS2 these are many reasons @ CAPS1 talking online can be better than using a phone . I remember one time a few years ago . Me and my cousin @ PERSON2 were alone at her house when the phone was not working @ PERSON2 went down stars to get us some sodas when I heard a crashing sound , @ PERSON2 had fallen down the stairs . Because the phones wren ' t opperating , i hopped to the computers in her room to quickly "" chat "" with my dad and tell him what happened . From these on , my dad called on ambulance and @ PERSON2 was allright . @ CAPS4 , not only are computers a great way to communicate , but they can also save somenes life ! Another feature computers have is that they can actually educate . For example , if a stuident has to write a paper for school about the @ CAPS3 , then they would need to do some research . The internet explorer on your computer can open your eyes to a world of kodedge . All you have to do is go to a search engin such as @ ORGANIZATION1 or @ ORGANIZATION2 and type in the subject you wish to learn more about . Before you know it , there ' s millions upon millions of websites that can educate you on the subject you want to gain more knoledge on . @ PERSON1 , a high school teacher , states that "" @ PERCENT1 of students in the school use the computer to help them with homework and reseacrh .

One last reason computers are @ CAPS4 beneficial for our society is because they can actually help you prepare for future jobs . Perhaps some day your child will get a job working in on office where they must use computers all day long . The heard of the company is not going to hire you if you are not expierenced with computers . However , if you know how to use a computer @ CAPS2 , then you have a great chance of getting a job that can support you and your family .

Say your bestfriend moved to @ LOCATION4 . You will not see her but you can talk to her on the computer . Now in day there are a lot of websites that you can chat off at or you can also do a webcam chat like ovoo . For example , in seventh grade I moved from @ LOCATION1 to @ LOCATION2 .

Consequently , computers help a lot you keep in touch with friends all over the world . Computers build up your skills for everything . Hand - eye coordination is the biggest skill that computers teach anyone . When your watching an adult type most of them can type without looking at the keyboard . This is an example of hand - eye coordination . Hand - eye coordination is very helpful in sports . In basketball you should dribble and look ahead . Kinda like typing .

Personally , I believe that computers benefit the society for many reasons . Computers help with education , career building , and helps people connect with family . By readin this letter , I hope that this make computers appealing to you . One reason why people benefit from computers is how they help with education . In a poll taken at @ ORGANIZATION1 , @ PERCENT1 of the students say that computers hel htem with their academic career . Also , many adults use computers for an education too . In the student body in class of ' @ NUM1 at @ CAPS2 high school , most of the students quit school before they could finish senior year . @ PERCENT2 of those students finished their high school and college years through online classes . Another reason how computers benefit the society is by helping with careers .

"" @ CAPS5 to a poll taken by @ CAPS4 ' s of many high ranning industries , @ PERCENT3 said that their business revolves around the internet . this could very we will be the poll your @ CAPS4 took . Finally , computers help families that are seperated , connect with each other . A marine said that he tries to contact his family as much as he can while he is at sea . If anyone deserves to contact their family that they have not seen in two years , it should deffinately be the people in the army . In conclusion , the computer technoligy has benefited many people .

How would you feel if no one was out getting excrise , and no one was using the playgrounds , parks and beachs . Everyone will be sitting at home on there nice new fanny computers . When you really do think about how much time people spend doing nothing , just sitting around , @ CAPS2 would a computer solve that problem ? It really @ CAPS4 ' t . This is what I would say to having computers , People spend to much time on computers , excrise is needed , everyday , and it makes your body wear and your eyes strained . When it comes to computers everyone wants to get one , but when we say excrise it seems like peoples mind click off . This happens because people are really starting to spend lots of time on computers . If they work on computers during a long period of the day , @ CAPS5 head home to spend more time on the computer , @ CAPS5 what is that doing to your body ? not helping it . I like computers to and I like spending time on them , when i need to get something done sometime that does not happen , because I get and I forget what time it is and that is not fun . Sometime this happens to people they are engaged in there computer , when someone is talking to them and your telling them something you need them to do , and there noding there head like they know what you sayed , but the next time you asked if it got done and it did not , you know they were listening . Excrise is really important for your body and doens ' t even have to be to got anything , but do not spend your time wasted on computers . This happens to @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 or families when they come home from work or school , and jump right on the computers , families are not getting enough excrise or spending time with family because computers get in the way of that . Excrise would help to keep you instead of electronics . Computers are like little robots that control your mind and body , it sucks the life cut of you . It strains your eyes it makes you wrat and you really do not want to do a lot , maybe if people spend less time on computers and more time being more focused on families and nature , they @ CAPS4 ' t be weak and tired . I know a lot of people who @ CAPS4 ' t want computers to be banned , but I think it would help for a lot of reasons and make families closer and bodys more focused , from my experience computers do help in some ways , but when it comes to real life it helps for really no one . i hope you understand @ CAPS2 I say these sort of things , but if you do care about health and activities @ CAPS5 you would say that computers are not a lot of help also .",9.0,195,3.989498754362378,26.105263157894736,19,0.39235412474849096,5.0,1.501006036217304,1.086987702339905,0.028169014084507043,19.0
9143,426,1,"Dear , @ CAPS1 of the @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS2 has come to my concern that many people are debating on whether computers benefit our society or not . Some people think computers are the lives of many people , but I have to disagree with those who say that . I think that computers benefits our society in there ways , they bring people together , they offer many websites to research a topic , and they let people shop at home . One way that computers help us is that they bring people together by using the internet . Many families do not live close to other relatives , making hard to see them . But with the internet , people can use social networking sites such as facebook or myspace to keep in touch with one another . Distant relatives can talk and share picture with one another to keep in touch . Also , the internet can help bring couple together and potentially lead to marriages . How @ MONTH1 times have you seen those @ CAPS3 harmony commercial that claim to have brought two singles together to make a happy couple ? Another way that computers help today ' s society is that they offer many places to conduct research on a certain topic . There are so many search engines on the internet that lead you to numerous websites to help you find out what you need to know . Also , researching a topic on the computer is so much easier compared to going to the library and reading books . When using books , to research a topic , you need to find the right book , read the whole thing or at least most of @ CAPS2 , and find what you are looking for . But with the internet , you just type in what you are looking for , click , and go . Lastly , computers let you shop online and lead to a better shopping experience . By shopping online , you skip the long lines at retail stores which means less time walking to get your product . For example , many people rush to stores early in the @ TIME1 for huge sales on "" @ CAPS4 @ DATE1 . "" A person could be left waiting in line for hours to get a product . Why wait outside for so long when you could just buy the product in the comfort of your own home and get the product delivered right to your house ? Also , many websites offer special deals for shopping online so you can even money .

9144,1224,1,"@ ORGANIZATION1 , @ CAPS1 a world without computers . Where would we get all of our information from ? Would we have to religh on television or magaziens , where information can be changed ? Or how would we ever get any reports done for work or home work ? I know many people who do not write neat , how will any one read it ? Basically , computers effect our lives so much in a good way that it would be chaos with out them . Computers allow people to learn how to type which can improve all around skills such as hand eye coordination , they let us connect with places we are not familiar with and see family members , and they allow people to have an online education which can help with the economy . Computers effect us in a very good way and they change our every day lives , @ CAPS2 children these days cannot type . A recent study done at @ ORGANIZATION2 showed that @ PERCENT1 of kids older than @ NUM1 already know how to type on a keyboard . Computers have such a big effect on us with so many skills that people do not ignoledge enough . Because all of thoes kids know how to type , they can spell better too . I remember one time when I was in the middle of writing a report online . I got @ NUM2 a word I did not know and had always had trubble spelling it . So I took my time and typed it out one letter at a time , and it was correct ! This example shows that computers can effect everyones lifes , even younger kids . The way that we get information from computers is just like the way our hands get information from our brain to move . For example , when babies learn how to walk the religh on their brains show them how it is done . This is just like how when there is a natural disaster , such as the earthquake in @ LOCATION1 we religh on our computers to show us and tell us what is going on and how something like this could happen .

My @ NUM3 year old cusin told me that she was happy her mom could go back to college from home because then they could spend time together . I know you might think that computers can make families get further apart but they actually bring them closer together .

Computers do not help you brain in any means possible . Think about it , sure you do alot of you work on computers but , what about your kids they spend most of their time gand online and doing pointless stuff . Instead they could be going outside or even study . the internet is open to the world so anyone goes on it and if your child is on the computer is exposed many vile things that will not help them in the future . it is a proven fact that the less time you spend watching tv or on the computer you get better grades . I remember my mom always yelled at me for being on the computer and getting bad grades so she took the computer away for a while and now i have much better grades . So being on the computer does not make you smarter . The computer can make you gain quit a bit of weight . If your on the computer a lot you are sitting around and a lot people eat while they are on the computer . So now you are sitting around the computer eating . That can make you gain weight . I know from experience that being active and going outside or exercising really makes you feel good . Once you gain all that weight it is very hard to get rid of it . Sitting around like a couch is not healthy . You can become obese . So you could say your happy with your weight but no one ever said it was healthy . A lot of people have died frombeing that beaky . It puts a huge tall on you life . If you do not want to die from being to heavy then I advise you to get off the computer and go outside and live yor life .

9148,1178,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 a student I believe that computers have many bad effects on people . Most people think that computers are just new helpful technology , but there is more to it than just that . There are many things going on in the cyber world . Computers are quite helpful in school research , work and other important stuff , but there are many bad effects too . Kids these days are so attached to their computers almost all day after getting home from school which means that they barely do homework , projects , and important assignments from getting too distracted by the computer . There are some parents who get tricked by their kids that they are just doing homework , but reality is that kids these times are meeting tons of strangers through social networks such @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 , @ CAPS4 , @ CAPS5 @ NUM1 , @ CAPS6 and other networks . Once that they decide to meet in person with these strangers many things go wrong because not everyone is @ CAPS2 nice @ CAPS2 they @ MONTH1 seem through the internet . It shows how dangerous it can be for kids to be using the computers so much . people such @ CAPS2 young children , pre teens and teenagers are able to view many harmful and inappropriate things anyone their ages should not be viewing at all . Another concern is how people spend all day on their computers probably eating any type of junk food and then they do not exercise at all and they gain weight and not we will fit physically which becomes a health issue for kids @ CAPS2 age @ NUM2 to much older people such @ CAPS2 age @ NUM3 and much older too which turns out to be a bad health life for people . From people spending nearly all day on the computer , they are not able to go out and discover new things , exercise , hang out with friends or just have fun and spend time with their families . I also do strongly consider that the computers or laptops should not stay in a kids room because then they lock themselves in their room all day and they even stay up till really late even past midnight and then it becomes a real issue for kids or adults to get up early in the @ TIME1 for school or work and are usually late . This pretty much shows how computers are not so great for people all the time .

9149,672,1,"Dear whomever it @ MONTH1 concern , @ CAPS1 name is @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 and I think that the effects that computers have on people is not good . I think this for a few different reasons . Those reasons are that because of them noboby goes out , people ; especially students loose penmanship skills , and people loose their desire to do normal everyday things . They make us lazy ! Because of computers people do not go out . They do not go for walks because their doing something on the computer . There is now no reason for anybody to ever visit a store of any kind because you can order everything online and have it delivered right to your front door . Also , for a lot of people , they do not even have to go to work . They can work for whatever company right from their home computer . People can even finish highschool and college on their computers , by taking online courses ! That brings me to @ CAPS1 next reason for computers haveing a bad effect on people . Students , can now type out all assignments , some schools even give laptops to students to use throughout the year . Being able to type out everything would mean that students would barely ever have to pick up a pen or pencil , makeing their handwriting worse from lack of practice . Another way computers have a bad effect on students is because of the internet . You can find any and everything on the internet , from math books to dictionarys and other resource books . Because of this some students do not even know how to look up a word in the dictionary , let alone find needed information in a book . I think this gives students a wrong idea and sence of reality . When they go to work , not everything will be done on a computer , but this is all they are being taught to use . Lastly , people are losing their desire to do everyday things . Why go out with friends when you can talk to them online ? Why go out to dinner when you can order it online ? People are starting to see no point in going out and doing things because there are "" more important things "" to do on the computer . I personally think they are brain - washing us and pretty soon the world is going to be one giant computer .

Even if a family can not go on a vacation they can still find from their computer cheeper closer things to do . When computers are beig used to find places and thing across the world and near you is they can also give teens the oppritunity to chat with their friends online . A lot of students in @ CAPS3 hallow school have a facebook account . Most use this account to talk to their friends online . I also have a facebook and I use it almost everyday to talk to my cousin from @ LOCATION1 that I have not scean sence I was @ NUM3 . But , computers are not just used for fun chating they can also be used for school blogs . In my language arts class we have a reading blog that every student has to participate in . This blog allows the class to not wast class time to talk about recently read books . In conclusion computers should be taken seriosly because they do help society . Computers help us every day , they teach us and they can be verry fun and eductional .

The issue to grapple with is , more and more people use computers , but not everyone agrees that this benefits society . I strongly think that @ CAPS2 does benifit society in many ways ! Heres why , the computer allows you to get in touch with friends , research people , places or things , and relax and enjoy playing on a fun , entertaining website ! My first reason is that @ CAPS2 allows you to talk to family or friends so you all get back in touch if a friend of yours moved to a diffrent state , then you can easily get back in touch straight from the computer . "" @ CAPS2 ' s nice to send emails or pictures to friends , but if you do @ CAPS2 from the computer then @ CAPS2 gets done so much faster ! "" @ CAPS3 @ PERSON1 , one of my neighbors . My next reason is that you can research anything you want like people , places or things and all refferances will come up . @ CAPS2 is good to research for any projects , or school assignments you @ MONTH1 have . I remember @ CAPS4 my brother was working on his project . Everything he had trouble with , he found directly on the computer !

9152,1591,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , @ CAPS1 has come to my attention that you have asked people to tell their opinions on the effects computers have on people . In my opinion computers do not have a good effect . The reason I think that is because kids are on the computer instead of doing their homework , people do not exercise as much because they are always on the computer and they do not spend as much time with their family and friends , @ CAPS2 are many kids that go on the computer all night and never get to doing their homework . I read an article that said , "" Computers are the number one problem for kids not doing their homework . "" People get @ CAPS4 distracted on the computer that they never end up doing anything else . Eight out of ten kids say that they sometimes do not do their homework because they get distracted on the computer . I interviewed a student in the @ NUM1 grade and she said , "" @ CAPS3 class inastly gets all homework done but sometimes we forget when we are on the computer . That is really the only reason we do not do @ CAPS1 . "" @ CAPS4 computers are not a very good electronic if kids are not getting their homework done because of @ CAPS1 . But that is not the only bad thing about them . Since people are always on computers they do not get out and exercise as much . Instead they sit and play games on a computer . I found this quote in an article I was reading "" @ CAPS5 since I started spending a lot of time on the computer I have gained weight because I am not out exercising , "" Exercising and going outside is a very important things to do but people cannot do @ CAPS1 if they are always on the computer . Nine out of ten people say that @ CAPS5 since they started going on the computer a lot , they have not gone outside or exercised in a while .

"" People get @ CAPS4 distracted on computers that they never go outside to exercise anymore . @ CAPS2 are still some reasons why computers are not very good .

In a magazine I read @ CAPS1 said , "" People are not spending time with their friends and family because they are on the computer instant messaging .

They help you with projects or homework but many experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers . I think that computers help people in many ways , like teaching a hand - eye coordination . they are useful because people can talk to friends and family members that they have not seen in a long time and computer skills are required in the real world . Hand - eye coordination is very important and using a computer can help people build up the coordination . This helps because if one has to type a @ NUM1 - page report , then one who has good hand - eye coordination , or typing skills , "" can finish a report in @ NUM2 minutes or so . If one has poor hand - eye coordination , we will that @ NUM2 minute report will take about a few hours . No one likes to be sitting infront of a computer for a few hours .

They might be forgotten or never seen from again . we will , thanks to technology and the advancement of computers , people can chat online on @ CAPS1 , @ ORGANIZATION1 instant messaging , myspace or facebook . They can catch upon things , check out what is new , even see posted pictures of them . The same thing can be applied to family members who have moved away . Who would not want to talk to friends or family that have not been heard from ? Lastly , having computer skills is very , very , very important in the real world . Skilled people who have a good knowledge of the computer world can get great jobs like a computer programer for the state , or they can create websites for their own jobs . Other jobs people with computer experience can have would be an editor of movies or @ CAPS2 shows . that is big money there . No wonder schools have computer classes . it is to get students to have a good background of the computer . Computers are not that bad .

9154,1658,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , I believe that computers have a negitive affect on people today . I believe this because computers cause people to be less active , most people would want to be at home on their computers then out side doing activities . I also belive computers restrict people who talk through it to show emotion . People should be out with each other when they talk not talking throught a machien . Finally if people were not on the computer as much they would bring down the obesity rate of the contry if everyone just stoped using technology for a while and wen outside .

Finally , @ CAPS4 is one of the most obese places in the whole world . People are sitting on the computer everyday , eating , and not moving at all and gaining weight .

9156,584,1,"Dear newspaper , I disagree with you about computers . I think that computers are helpful with projects , homework , or letters . For example you can use a computer to help you with projects , if you have a project to do and you do not feel like going to the library , you can use a compater to look up information on just about anything . And you do not have to draw pictures , that is what printers are for . Also when you have homework most kids or teenagers , even adults do not like doing homework , that is what a computer do for you can just look up the anser online and then your done in no time . Let ' s say you have to write a essay I know nobody likes to write essay ' s by hand you can type @ CAPS1 and design @ CAPS1 with your own designs and make @ CAPS1 look nicer than you writing @ CAPS1 . Further more I know nobody likes to keep up with and if you lose @ CAPS1 then you have to start over and that takes forever to do especially if @ CAPS1 ' s due the next day , you get bored and you do not feel like writing @ CAPS1 over and you get mad because you already did @ CAPS1 . And when you had @ CAPS1 in you mysteriously find you other paper that you finished and lost and @ CAPS1 makes you so angry . And then you have to worry about if someone store @ CAPS1 and copied @ CAPS1 and put their name on the copied one but changed some of your ideas around so that they would not lose major points and grade drops from a @ CAPS2 to a @ CAPS3 in no time flat . Lastly you can use a computer write finds of letters . You can write a that and people ' s report card ' s if your a teacher , and you can also write a letter to friend that mights have moved away . Therefore the types of letters you should be writing are love letters to yor wife or girlfriend at work or in school and @ CAPS1 fast too instead of writing @ CAPS1 and then you hards start to the worst kind of way . So instead you can write @ CAPS1 fast and they get @ CAPS1 fast if they have computer but if they work at a school then they can get because every school should have a computer so they will be able to get @ CAPS1 . Another kind of letter you can write is a letter to your friend that you have not seen in years or that has moved to another country or to another state so I hope now I have convinced you about why @ CAPS1 is @ CAPS4 to have a computer but as you sad @ CAPS1 itsn ' t always @ CAPS4 to be on the computer @ NUM1 but once in a while @ CAPS1 okay especially in an emergency if someone has just died in your family and you do not know how to get there use a gas , and if you do not have a gas go online and print out the directions so that you can get their and see which family member died and if you knew that so now that you know the importance of a computer .

Another thing I like are sports . One of my favorite sports is softball . In softball you need to have hand - eye cordination , this will help you swing at the ball more accuratly . When a pitcher throws the ball you have to had the bat at the right angle and watch the ball to know when to swing if kids used computers and become good at hand - eye cordination , then possibly more kids would join a local sports team , and possibly even join travel team .

Do computers make harm ? we will , for one thing , I know that computers can take up ! a lot of peoples time . For example , many people do not go outside as much . This is because most people are usually on their computers . What are they doing on the computer you ask ; we will lets , find out . There are many things a person can do on a computer . It can be fun chatting , educational or hard working . A lot of people use a computer for fun . For example , many people use the computer to chat with their friends . There are many sites to chat with friends . That can usually take up a lot of peoples time . A lot people can talk for hours on the computer and that is what takes up their time instead of going outside . Another example is the games that people are playing . To me , the computer games are one of the biggest problems . This is because a lot of the games can be to much fun , that it can be find a game and play it all the time . This can not only take up their time outside , but it can ruin their life . The game can be so addictive that kids and adults might not get their work done . That can cause failure in school or getting fired at work . On the other side though , a lot of people use a computer for work and school .

This is a good thing about computers , but also a bad thing . It is a good thing because now people can get their work done faster . This is a bad thing because it is another reason to stay inside . For work , people depend on computers . They save work on their and they use computers to build things . For exemple , people use a computer to program a robot . Although they use computers for a good reason people should make time for outside . A lot of people need to take breaks off the computer : because computers can do harm . This is because if they spend all their time on the computer they can get sick . Going outside , exercizing and getting fresh air is very important . So people out there , get off your computer .

9168,1124,1,"Dear @ PERSON2 - @ CAPS1 , I strongly suggest that people do not spend as much time on computers as they do comently . People will be doing much better things , such as exercising or spending more time with family and friends . Both these things are better for people ' s body and mind , and one more useful later in life . Please consider the following about why it will be more beneficial @ CAPS2 people do not spend as much time on computers . First , exercising is an exellent alternative to sitting at a computer screen . A recent study by @ ORGANIZATION3 and the @ ORGANIZATION1 studies found that an average person spent five hours per day on the computer . By cutting out at least some @ ORGANIZATION1 these hours , people will be able to make time for more exercise in their daily routine . Also , @ PERSON3 at @ ORGANIZATION4 says that "" @ PERCENT1 @ ORGANIZATION1 people do not exercise enough in the @ LOCATION1 alone . "" @ CAPS2 some free time being on the computer is taken away , people will reward themself by taking care @ ORGANIZATION1 their bodies . Moreover , I tried not using my computer for a week , and it was a great experience because in that free time I learned how to do a back flip in gymnastics . There are so many possibilities in exercising @ CAPS2 people do not use their computer as much . Second , @ CAPS2 people do not spend as much time on the computer , they get more experience with social skills . For example , @ PERSON1 at @ ORGANIZATION5 says "" @ CAPS2 people spend time with family and friends , they gain necessary social skills for later in life . "" A study at @ ORGANIZATION2 showed that people who spend three hours or less on their computers have up to @ PERCENT2 better social , verbal , and quick - thinking skills . Spending time with people ' s family and friends in stead @ ORGANIZATION1 on the computer is exremely beneficial . I try to spend at least three hours a day spending time with family and friends and I have good relationships with them . Clearly , it is better to spend less time on the computer , and more time exercising or spending time with family and friends .

They can offer things that just writing things down or a pece of paper can not , like being able to learn about things that are not taught in school , you can talk with friends online and you can keep everything in one .

But the computer can give you the news in an article then show you it in a video . Also in my opinion the news from the internet is visually less condensed than on @ CAPS1 .

Emailing is great , it is so hi - tect you can email one of your family members who live thousand miles away from you . I once did that my aunt ' s lisa was in florida and i asked her to send me pictures of the water and the beaches and she did , they were eye catching . Next reason why computers are good to have is for jobs . In todays world everything is ran by computers for example each registers . A . T . M . and car are ran off of computers . So having it for a job is great . Lets your tells you to fax over a copy can do it the computer within a minute i know my dads job requires of he keeps it all to his witch on his desktop on his laptop . This is why most jobs have computers . Do you are one ? Lastly , school was computers . For example my teacher on his computer atendence , homework and . If he did not have that , he would be lost . it is also good for the kids too . Every week in social studies we have to look up the presidents and i use my laptop for that . Did you know is a program were you can look at your grades and missing assignments ? it is call power school . Computers are great for school . I think every one should have one . So what do you think about them ? Are they amazing or what ? I think are very helpful because you can use them for emailing , working , and school work .

Would you go outside and maybe @ CAPS3 the soccer ball around with your kids , or grab a bag of chips and log onto facebook or your email ? The question is , do computers have a negative or positive effect on people . I believe that computers have a negative effect . Talking to friends on the computer does not let you learn social skills . Going on the computer can also be very addicting . Finally , it take ' s away from all the exercise you need . I @ CAPS4 that after careful consideration you will agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people . Facebook , ichat and email are all fun and easy ways to talk to your friends and family online . However , are you really gaining any social skills by doing this ? Talking to friends and family online does not help you have good social skills . When you first meet someone in person , you most likely want to @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2 to say and how to act . Typing on a keyboard does not really let you interact with people . @ CAPS6 not invite someone over , or go out to lunch with your family istead ? Computers also are very addicting . I can say for myself that once I log onto the computer , I might not be off for the next hours . This is the case for many other people too . Going on the computer is addicting . Il @ CAPS4 that not everyone is using a computer on a daily basis the vast majority of people are . When I am on facebook and I see the number of people online is one hundred or even two hundred , as time goes by , the number increases . The computer being addicting leads to getting enough exercise . Doctors say that adults and kids should get atleast an hour of exercise a day . Going on the computer takes away from this time . Instead of sitting on the computer for an hour , you could be getting your hour of exercise . instead A lot of times when someone @ CAPS5 down at the computer , a snack goes with them . This just adds onto the fact @ CAPS6 getting the exercise is important to stay healthy . I @ CAPS4 that I would feel a lot better if I went for a run instead of going on the computer .

9194,721,1,"Dear local newspaper , it has came to @ CAPS2 attention that many people do not agree if computers have a beneficial or bad affect on those who use them . In @ CAPS2 oppinion they are not beneficial . First when on the computer people have less time to exercise . Also , computers do not always have approprate sites . Finally , people have less time to interact with family and friends . I believe for these reasons that computers have bad affects on people . Without a doubt people who spend hours on the computer everyday have less time to excersice @ NUM1 in every @ NUM2 young adults are obiese . This is because most teens sit inside watching @ CAPS1 or going on the internet instead of being active . Some students are so addicted to computers they never go outside ! I understand that computers can be helpful to do school work but , kids who never get off can have life threatening weight problems in the future . As you know many web sites that are not appropriate for teenagers are accesible to them on the computer . Parents have to constantly worry what their child / children are doing just to make sure it is not bad . If less teens used computers as often as they do they would be lifting a nof their parents shoulders . I remember reading a newspaper article about a girl named @ PERSON1 on a website chatting with a "" @ NUM3 year old guy who later came and found her and turned out to be @ NUM4 . If kids were not so addicted to the computer than they would not get into these websites . many teens spend there whole day on the computer leaving no time for their family and friends . For example when a friend calls and asks @ CAPS2 brother to go skateboarding he says he is busy when he is just on facebook , @ CAPS2 friend once said to me "" sorry I can not go to the pool today I am going to play rollercoaster tycoon . "" With this attitude toward outdoor activities I am not surprised that students wasting time on computers do not have time for family or friends .

Statistics show that @ PERCENT1 of all children who are permitted to talk with friends , out of school stay off of drugs and promote a stronger education and grades .

If a family member is in the service somtimes talking on the computer is the only chance they get to commnunicate with their loved ones back home . Saying that this is not a benifit is a lie . For others who do not have such sevier need of communicating it is still a convinient way to have a conversation with someone far away without racking up the phone bill for a long distance call . Also many times this can be an altenative to parents buying their children expensive cell phones . So having a computer is defanitly a benifit to communiting . The computer can also make many tasks much esier , for example if you were assiangned a @ NUM1 pages essay in school typing it on the computer would be much neater and quicker than writing it all out . Also many buisnesses relay on computers to keep data organized and all in place . Like the program excel , @ ORGANIZATION2 created this to make a simple way to organize data . It is much more efficient than than having every thing in different site with millions of texters in every draw . So another benifit of the computer is that it can keep tthings organized and poride easy ways to complete evey day tasks . Maybe the greatest benifit of the computer is how much you can learn so easily . Say I was curiouse about the recent earthquake in @ LOCATION2 , if I wanted more inofrmartion @ CAPS3 head straight to the computer . You simply go to @ ORGANIZATION3 or another search engine of your choice , type in the subject , one click , and bam you could read for hours all of the websites and articles that would come up . The computer is full of information , and is right at our finger tips , this is definitly a huge benifit to our socierty . The computer is a wonderful tool that can asist in so many ways , wether it is communication organization , or just curiosity . This advance in technology is just another way to improve every day life . Computers do not just benifit our little town of @ LOCATION1 , they benifit our whole socoety in all of the amazing things they do .",9.0,238,4.472033470803233,19.95833333333333,24,0.4958333333333334,6.0,1.6791666666666667,1.1752835873133531,0.05625,24.0
9204,1728,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 I believe that there is more and more controvosy about computer and whether they benefit society or not . In my opinion , computers are a wonderful resource that will soon become a household item . I am writing to persuade you that computers have a positive effect on people . I believe computers are a good thing because they allow people access to more knowledge , they allow people to stay in contact with people they do not see very often , and they allow people to keep up and know what is going on in modern life . One reason computers are useful is that they allow people to stay in contact with people they do not see very often . Today , parents do not mind sending their children off to college as much because they can actually see them using video chat websites like @ ORGANIZATION1 . This feature on computers has a big impact on the life of people today . People in @ LOCATION1 can talk with people in @ LOCATION2 . This type of often allows for people to share new and inventive things they have discovered . Another reason computers can be useful is because they help people keep in touch with modern life . Many companies are now erasing newspaper ads and putting them all on computer websites . Some companies are only selling items on their websites and shipping them to the buyers . With computers students can also get their homework done and send it to their teacher by email if they cannot make it to school that day . There is even at home colleges now where you take your class online . I believe that in a few years from now more and more people will do business with computers and more stores will sell online only . Finally the last reason I believe computers are a good idea is that they allow people access to more knowledge with the internet . There are websites soldy devoted to history and information on many things . Also there are blogging websites where people can debate on information or get questions answired by real people who @ MONTH1 know a lot about the topic . Another thing on computers that helps you get informed is websites like wikipedia where people can search a topic , read history about it , and follow links to other websites if they want to pick apart the topic even more . Overall , I believe that computers area a great resource to human kind and will be used for more and more things in a few years . I believe computers are useful because they allow people access to more knowledge , the ability to keep in touch with others , and to keep in touch with modern life . I believe that in a couple years there will be liss stores on the streets and most will be online because it is much cheaper for the companies . So , most people in a couple years will be computers and use them effectively .",9.0,200,4.409083963145197,21.26086956521739,23,0.4081632653061225,6.0,1.6693877551020408,0.9876925088958034,0.018367346938775512,23.0

Students who use computers are more skilled than kids who do not by learning all the software and hour to be safe when online . Computers teach kids hand eye coordination , which can come in handy when playing sports . Also they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people . Finally it allows people to talk online with other people . Computers make people develop hand eye coordination . When someone plays a sport live baseball or basketball , hand eye coordination is definetly needed . say your a catcher , and then catch it . Almost every sport needs hand eye coordination and computers help you get it . Hand - eye coordination can also be useful to people with jobs . If you work with computers for a job , it is helpful to be we will known wit the keyboard for fast results . Mostly any job along with sports requires hand - eye coordination . Some people have the gift that they have hand - eye coordination when there born , but for people who do not practice is the best thing . Learning about faraway places / people is always facinating . On computers towns can put up webpages with pictures , information or even ways to help you plan a vacation . Theres also @ ORGANIZATION1 . @ ORGANIZATION1 can help you find any place or you can find out anything about that place . Computers even give you the abilty to plan or visit a loc location by buying tickets online or maybe you just want to read what the place is like , you can do all that . Finally , computers can be taken any place with you and say you go to @ LOCATION1 , and you do not speak there language , we will you can go to a translating site and figure out what things mean . Facebook , @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 , all of these sites make it possible for you to talk with other people . Personally , I have a facebook , aim , and even a e - mail . A lot of the time I will go on facebook and talk to my friends from school and even my cousins that I do not get see a lot . Talking online helps you interact with other people that you might not see in school or around town , and also your friends that might not have a cell phone . It helps you learn social skills that everyone needs . Computers give you all that . it is easy and free way to talk to anyone you know whenever you want . In conclusion , computers have a positive effect on people . Almost everyone uses computers , and they are not difficult to use .

9207,824,1,"Dear editor , I hear you are looking for your citizens opinion in if computers are bad or good . @ CAPS1 opinion is computers are bad . I think computers are bad in three ways and I want to express them to your and hopefully persuade you into going towards @ CAPS1 side . Smell nice out to day . I can smell flowers , the grass , and many more , @ CAPS1 first reason why computers are bad is if you use the computer to much you do not see enough of enjoying nature . Nature is beautiful , it has @ CAPS2 , green grass , rainbows ( sometimes ) . You can make a walk of in the moons and just be yourself and be by yourself . In other words nature is very nice and you should set out and enjoy it . If you do not enjoy nature it might be no late , because soon it become and rainy and then , yes fem has flabberlasting colors , but what comes after fall , winter . Winter is not nice , it is cold . You work , because you need to shovel the drive way and your car off and that can get very tire some . The goof of is you can get those chorse . Oh not that make me to . @ CAPS1 next reason why computers are bad . When was a good smile run . @ CAPS1 next reason why I think computers are bad is spend all working and no time exersing . Excersing is a very fun thing to do , you fel to go outside . Hang with friends , any many shore . Exercise is a main way of staying healthy . do not you can really get unhealthy , and sick and his dies , die i have a friend whom nothing use . The computer his body rest weaker and weaker so exercise ias am main piece of staing healthy . there are many ways to health you can bike , run , walk , rog canate , climb a mountain , etc . The posibilitys are endless while exercesing in the park you never knew you can meet . car ' s fast say your friend , "" yo sup man , "" "" not , you "" "" not much , just fiding around for some exercise "" "" same here , same here "" see you never know who you can meet in the park now that was @ CAPS1 friend . he is alwasys here , out how as you think , yep in the same park . I would not have met him if i was insine on the computer . Like i said be what was @ CAPS1 friend . But since I come here every day i can meet a new friend every day maybe . So @ CAPS1 last reason why I think the computer is bad is because you do not get enough interacting time with friends and family . I love @ CAPS1 family but I interact with them . If they are exercising who if i am here on the computer . no one can . In conclusion I think the computer are bad because you can not get enought time exercising , enjoying nature , and spending @ CAPS3 time with family and friends .",9.0,224,4.819227095823353,14.87878787878788,33,0.4552845528455284,5.0,1.5060975609756098,1.5733553850075008,0.024390243902439025,33.0
9208,269,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 , yes , I do believe that for too many people are ' addicted ' to the computer , and spread more than enough time on the computer everyday ! Not only teenagers but the children and youth have fall into trap of the computer . As I grew up in my younger years I hated the computer all I wanted to do was go outside and play . As I became older I used the computer way more often than I did before I now believe the computer takes time away from family time to get the sitting down to read a good book and hanging out with friends . Insteed of all those fun interacting activities people decide to go on facebook , myspace , twitter , youtube , addicting games , and whatever else they could find . I do not agree with that being sluck to the computer like is to chese . No ! If there was our thing in the world that would keep parents and children together , it is not the computer . Computers distracts kids and teenagers from doing other things in life , also it does not follow families to be a family . Before computers were made all people bad was their family .

Okay , I @ MONTH1 understand that some people just @ MONTH1 not like to go out and play or engage in physical exercise and that is totally understandable that is still no excuse for sitting at the computer and a book .

Computers teach hand eye coordinator by training your hand to go where your brain tells it to and where your eyes show it . Hand eye coordination is very important . It can help people drives it decreases reaction time and it can help people write more neatly . If it can help a driver turn his wheel faster or hit his break I think that hand eye coordination could help that driver stay out of an accident . Think of a climber trying to grab a on a mountain .

Just for a moment , think what would the world be like without computers . I feel the computers one or important aspect of our lives . Computers are espicially important to students and teachers . For instance if a student needed to do a report on @ LOCATION1 , he could look up facts and other things on @ LOCATION1 , then he could condence the facts into a paragraph on a word document , and if he had a question he could email his teachers . Finaly he , could print out the finished report . All that , without having to get up and bother his parrents to go to the bookstore and pay @ NUM1 on a book that he will probably read one time . Also if he had a question there would be no comunication outside of school . Anothe example of students using computers is online textbooks , which spares them of logging heavy texbooks home . Because I know computers have helped me in school and more work much easier . Secondly , @ PERCENT1 of busnesses say that they use computer daily , and some agree that without computer , their busnesses would fail . Computer make busnes much easier , espically with the busness monoging and file keeping programs that are oidible . On a computer , busnesses can store customer information , comppare income , and keep stock of inventary without having a cluttered pile or file cobinet . Computers can also saave buseness money because that con cut out jobs such as record keeper . Also busnesses con save time of having meeting via web cams instead of having people drive from state to state for one meeting then do it next monet and the month after ; and they coud emall impertant things such as sales projections and other things as we will . Computers are also important and helpful in the home . People can do grocery shopping from the home they can order pizza online and they can go shopping online . Also , people can pay their bills online which saves paper . Lets say this , a moter , has a child ! who is sick and she wants to know the to heal him , what to feel him , and what medicine to give hime . She can look all this up on the computer and bookmail the websites for next time . Then her other child comes provide , and she wants to find a health snork . She can feed him which she ca do online . Next she ways to make chicken fried rice , out she wnet know how , she can look up the recipe online . Finaly after dinner she need to cleen a stain on the carpet but it will not come out so she buys a carpet cleener from the web . Computers have just moderthy mothers day so much easier . Without computers our lives would be much harder .

If you are on the computer you type which helps improve peoples hand - eye coordination . Also , you can learn more about people , places , cultures and much more . Lastly , you can communicate online with other friends or even meet new people . To begin , I think having computers is a good idea because it helps people improve on their handeye coordination . My cousin @ PERSON3 , who is a big time baseball player , used to have trouble catching the when he was younger . He kept trying over and over again and never gave up . Then , for his birthday his parents bought him a computer ! He was so excited , but when it came to typing papers , he was not the best . Not only did he practice baseball but also typing .

"" Computers have two things in one , you learn to type and help your hand eye coordination . Do you want you @ CAPS3 to be lacking that positive ability in life ? In addition , computers help you learn more about people , places and cultures . I heard a couple nights ago that @ ORGANIZATION2 had an earthquake . I also learned about the powerplant explosion in @ LOCATION2 , @ LOCATION1 . How do I know all of this you ask ? The front page on @ CAPS2 . com ! But , I am not the only one who has gained this knowledge from the internet , so many more have too . @ ORGANIZATION1 took a poll about how many @ CAPS3 use the computer to do research and @ PERCENT2 answered that they did . Does the society really want to take away @ CAPS3 knowledge of what is going on around us and our history ? In conclusion , people can communicate with friends and relatives . This is great if you have not seen them recently , or if you want to just stay in touch . For example , @ PERSON4 , mycousin , just found me on facebook . I have not seen her for eight years abut now I talk to her all the time . We talk about visiting each other and how our family ' s are doing . But , you can also talk to your friends too .

9219,798,1,"I walked into my living room one night and saw my mom on the computer . I thought to myself "" she is always on that computer , does not she work to do ? "" . I said to my mom "" I think we should have an hour two of the computer each night , or not have one at all . "" I told her that I think computers are a bad choice because you do not know who is on the internet and is trying to talk to you . Also , it gets in the way of exercising and spending time with family and friends . The internet / computers are very dangerous now a days . You never know if someone is a friend or a predator trying to get you . Say if you were talking to someone and you thought it was your friend , we will you do not know for sure if it is then or not . I could be an older man or women trying to get a hold of you so they can probably kidnap you . Steal from you and worse . Now I watch the news and see many kidnapping because kids are talking to people on the internet and do not know who they are or what they look like . Like , when a girl was talking to a man and she thought it was her friend , turns out it was not and she got in a whole lot trouble . Maybe if she met him she would have gotten very hurt and be scared of that memory for the rest of her life . Family is very important to most families now a days . I have heard that spending time with family would bring your grades up in school because as you talk to them , you learn new things . Sadly this is not happening because people are so isolated to their computers they do not spend one minute with family or friends . I have a friend who is always on the computer . She never spends time with her family or friends . She is so focused on the computer screen then what is going on around her . Recently she has been getting off the computer and making more time with family and friends . Even her grades started going up because she spending more time studying with her mom and dad , then being on . for example @ CAPS1 or myspace and not getting any work done for school . In other words , she is very happy in life now and has changed from this experience she has gone through . Most people think you can use your brain for knowledge and call it exercise . That is one way to put it but it is not exercise for your body . People have spent more time having their eyes glue to the computer screen that they do not go out and play or maybe go a gym . The rate of obecity in our country is increasing for many reasons and lack of exercise is one of them because people spend to much time watching tv and being on the computer . I have a little cousin who is over weight and should be out playing sports and exercising . But does she , "" no "" . She spends her free time on the computer in a stuffy room , instead of getting fresh air from outside . She keeps asking me how did I get and what age , and I keep telling her , I exercise and play sports so I can not tell you when . I keep saying that to her but she never listens . To this day she is still the same because she did not take my advice to get off the computer and go outside to play . I strongly agree that we should have only two hours of the computer each night or have no computers at all . For kids saftey from bad people out there in the world , spending time with family and friends and finally for exercise and to stay fit with our bodies . I hope people understand what I say and take action to persue them in they own life and convice others too .",9.0,261,5.050499256958129,18.37837837837838,37,0.3832599118942731,5.0,1.4170337738619676,1.304144762690648,0.005873715124816446,37.0

Also if I had to research a topic for @ CAPS1 history project then I would go onto the computer , to google and then type in @ CAPS1 topic and be overwelmed by getting the info that I needed and got an at on the project that is how computers help you learn more .

Not only dose it have a good effect on people it also effects companies places and governments . There are many reasons why it has a good effect on people but the first and maybe one of the most important is it is an amaizing learning tool . When people are on the internet they could learn just about anything they want to on the giant mass of information we call the internet . It not only dose this but people learn how to do things through simulators from flying a plane to driveing a car . There is even more learning ability on the internet because a lot of people get home schooled on it through the internet and this @ MONTH1 be an important part of their education because they might not be able to go to school because they are alway on the road or they move a lot of whatever their reason is .

Even if you were a construction worker you could your blue prints with pinpoint accuracy . Another less important thing about the computer is it gives many people entertainment . Lets you come home your bored you have nothing to do play a video game look around on the internet , it is also an important way of getting their music and or videos . This also effects many buissness and if the buissness go under becaus people were not moving ther stuff a lot of jobs will be lost and that is the last thing we need . The government also relies highly on the internet . They need it to make plans , save soldiers , and comunicate with other countries .

This made me very unhealthy I gained nine pounds in one week . Now , I have dietbeaties . I can not enjoy things like sweets or running . I will probably have arthritus in my hands when I am older because I spent hours typing away . I used the computer in the dark so now I need contacts .

I missed out on alot of activities with my friends and family because I was so busy online . I barely talked to anyone unless it was through email . I lost alot of friends and close family members . My pets died because I did not take care of them . I did not really want to do anything but go on the net . I messed up on colledge and job interviews . To this day I have no social life and no job because I spent more time socializing with the computer than people . Computers ruined my life . Computers incourage very bad things . Not just unhealthy choices and antisocial behavior they uncourage things against the law . Alot of drugs and weapons are bought online . People kill others or themselves because people gossiped about them online . People do not care for nature and destroy it . People steal so they can buy extra technology . Alot of car robbers happen because someone left technology in there . People gamble through online poker . People hack bank acounts through the computer . Prostitution happens because of online chats . Thier are sex affenders that go online posing as people that want a date when they are rapists . Terrorists can communicate by the internet .

Some people do not like computers . The think computers are ruining social skills and healthy bodys . The reason I am writing to you is to presuade those people to realize the greatness that lies inside a computer . For starters computers help us recive / give @ CAPS8 . One of the great featurs that computers give is email . Without email , we would be completley out of the loop . For example @ CAPS2 there is a snowday at your childs school , you recive an email from the usper intendent saying school si cancled . Without that email , we woulden ' t be able to know that @ CAPS8 . Another example , @ CAPS6 say that you lost your voice to a terrible cold . You do not feel good and need to call work to report being sick . Now you are stuck because you have no voice . @ CAPS2 you had a computer , you could have simply emailed your boss . Another posative tool computers gives us is making communicating esayer . With all of the social networking now avalible like @ CAPS4 , twitter , @ CAPS3 and yahoo messanger . It nearly impossible not to stay in contact with friends and faimly using @ CAPS4 , you can look up old friends and faimly . Once you have found them , you can friend request them and become online friends . Once you are online friends you can instant message , video chat , look at their status , and browse their photos . So with a computer @ CAPS7 nearly impossible not to be able to keep in touch . The last and final reason computers are great is because , they make shopping much esayer . @ CAPS2 you have used amazon , ebay or overstock , you know what I am talking about you can buy almost anything online . From electronics to @ CAPS5 animals . The list is endless . With a computer you can even get your house hold groceries online . For example @ CAPS6 say your home from work with explosive diharrea . But @ CAPS7 @ DATE1 so you need to go grociery shopping . you have been on the toilet @ PERCENT1 of the day and alls you have got is your laptop . we will you can shop online .

Looking at places far away is always an option . You can even simply use it to help with homework essays . Locating and researching , even going to different countries , even different continents is possible to do on the computer . You can buy plan tickets . reserve rooms , even reserve tables at resturants in different countries by just a few clicks . Another thing is , you can research countries , towns , and cities with google instead of having to go out and get books . Reading about and talking to people from different countries is always an option . Being able to talk . and read about people and go to countries just by a clicking a button is pretty amazing . Computers also allow us to talk and communicate to people when there is no other way . The computers give people the ability to talk and see people they they the would never communicate with anymore . An example of this is my father had not see his father since he was two , but he started communicating with him and we were able to see him and chat with him through web chat . So these web chatting websites ; ooVoo , facebook , myspce , skype , etc , is allowing people to reconnect . This advantage is allowing friendships and relationships to continue , is that really bad ? Computers can help people with their homework and essays . For instint , they can type and print their essays instead of having to write it on paper . This helps because first it makes their , it also can be changed quicker and easier . They also can get information about what they are studying quickly and more efficiently . Instead of searching for a word in a big dictionary they can use an online dictionary and just have to type in the word . Online dictionary also have prounociation help and different langages . This helps so much so they can get their work done and exercise , enjoy nature , or interact with family and friends .

Finally people who always play video games on computers begin to lose terms of reality . Computers are turning this nation into a bunch of mindless slothes .

Most kids by the age of @ NUM1 have already used a computer for over @ NUM2 hour . This shows that kids spend more time using the computer then anything else . I had a friend named @ CAPS1 who used the computer @ NUM3 and eventually he was so weak and scrawny from lack of exercise that you could snap his arm like a twig .

Because of the fantesy content people might start to lose sight of reality . For example , scientest tested a video game on kids , and now @ PERCENT1 believe in zombies . Now they cannot ever play the game for it might cause serious brain damage . Just to make sure you get my point , let us recap .

Computers teach a lot of hand eye coordination . Study ' s show that @ PERCENT1 of all football players have excellent hand eye coordination . I am sure this is because after the football players get home from a big game or something they log into @ CAPS2 and make thier status all about thier win . Plus , they probably pull up pingball and see how long they can go without getting the little ball down the hole . Do you have good hand eye coordination ? My second reason that I disagree with the previous statement would have to be that computers give people the ability to learn about far away places without ever leaving home I mean @ CAPS1 is so much faster than having to go to the library . At the library you would have to first get there , secend pick out your book , and third check @ CAPS1 out . with a computer in all that time you could be completely finished with you whole project ! Finally , the reason why computers are so important is because @ CAPS1 keeps people in touch . Do you have family members who live far away from you ? I @ CAPS3 I do . I can not always call them on the phone @ CAPS4 I want to talk to them so I just log on to @ CAPS2 and if there online I can have my conversation with that person . I do not @ CAPS3 about you but I am really close to my grandma . Unfortanitly she does not even live anywhere close to @ NUM1 hours to me . She is way down @ LOCATION2 in @ LOCATION1 .

9254,1166,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 , Computers are helpful once in a while but @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 people believe that they are a waste of electricity . Computers are not beneficial to everyday life overall . When people are on the computer they spend multiple hours on it . This means that they are not getting enough exercise and that they are harming them bodies . Not only this but people have a tendency to use this machine obsessivly . They spend more attention on the computer and not enough time with your family . Every one knows exercise is important . However , what happens when we do not get enough ? Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the @ LOCATION1 . Heart disease is caused by obesity . that is what happens when you do not exercise . When you are on the computer you are sitting down rather than moving around . This means that your motabolism is not going and you burn less calories . That is not healthy for anyone . Even people in perfect condition . Gaining weight is not the only way you can potentially harm your body . When using the computer you have to look at the screen which is with very bright @ CAPS3 lights . After looking at the screen for so long your eyes will begin to feel the affects of the lights . Many people say it is like staring into a flashlight for an extended amount of time . About @ PERCENT1 of the kids at our school wear glasses because of using the computer for to long . That @ PERCENT1 is @ PERCENT2 more than we had before . We used to have about @ NUM3 . Like I said before , when you use the computer you use it for an extended amount of time . What about family ? They deserve more attention than a machine . To spend more time on the computer than your own flesh and blood is not right . In a survey an average of @ NUM4 out of @ NUM5 people said that the spent about eight hours on the computer between work and home , and about an hour with family . The results were more than shocking with all of this in mind , ask your self how useful the computer really is . Sure it is good at researching things quickly but it is also good at making people gain weight , making people spend money on glassses and tearing them away from their family members . At the end of the day , the computer is not very helpful at all .",9.0,198,4.7222962547424485,13.6,30,0.4841075794621027,6.0,1.5721271393643033,1.53012496531497,0.034229828850855744,30.0
9256,615,1,"Computers should be for everyone ! do not you think ? I do . And here ' s how @ CAPS1 gonna convince you . Computers can basically be called a gateway to learning . Positive effects that computers have on peole is that , it teaches hand - eye coordination , give people the ability to learn about faraway places , and even allow people to talk online with other people . These great qualities computers have for people are fantastic . Also the fact that computers just keep upgrading as time goes by . So , by you reading this introduction , I hope you are satisfied with what I am going to in order to show you that computers are positive devices and can be helpful to everyone . Firstly , as I started in my introduction paragraph , computers help teach people hand - eye coordinates . This i believe is a good thing to know because without it , there are not many things you could do . For example fly a plane . You would not be able to do that without both hand and eye coordinates because you would have to manually move the plane , and check to see if everythings in order by multi - tasking . Furthermore , this is just one given reason on why computers are positive towards everyone ' s benefit . Secondly , computers give people the ability tolearn about faraway places and people . This is also good for people ' s benefits because , theres knowledge in every bit of it . Your learning about others cultures , heritage , family history , and so forth and so on . This could also help you in the long run with any job you want to do because knowledge can get you anywere . It can get you very far in life so learn as much as you can , and I beleive computers can do so . This is another reason why computers can be positive . As for the last reason , I say that peolple can also talk to other people online on the computer . This is also beneficial because again , like I stated in my @ NUM1 paragraph , you can learn many things that way and meet new people . Now do not you think computers can benefit anyone ! I do and will always have the same opinion that is positive towards computers . For my conclusion , I would like to say that I hoped you enjoyed every bit of what I had to say , and you can also agree with the positive affects computers have on people . I truly beleive that computers are beneficial to all people and should continue to be around . it benefits society , and I enjoy every bit of using it . Thank you .",9.0,188,4.535521194796341,15.357142857142858,28,0.4361948955916473,6.0,1.6937354988399071,1.4701429793353156,0.018561484918793503,28.0

In @ CAPS3 opinion , computers have a positive impact on the world around us . I believe @ CAPS4 gives people hand - eye coordination and a way to be organized . Not only those but , people are still interacting with others . if you do not beleve me now , read @ CAPS3 details and you will feel the same way I do . When you consider @ CAPS4 , computers give us hand - eye coordination . there ' s no way to use a computer without typing . No matter if you are just typing in a short password or a @ NUM1 page essay , you will alway have to type , and when you do @ CAPS4 allows better movement at your hands . This can later help you in sports when you get out and exercise . Since computers have become such a popular thing , i think that in the future , typing or using a computer will be in the @ CAPS2 . this could be of the hand - eye coordination @ CAPS4 gives @ CAPS3 theory is whatever you think , you type . in addition to hand - eye coordination , computers provide organization which is a big concern in present day life . Do you have picture files laying your house ? we will , there ' s no need to . With computers you store all and files neatly . how your might you can bark those easy to find everything becomes all that are locate . Even doctors are computers your medical needs and give time . Computers can give organize . Furthermore , computers continue to help instead with store say keep friends I can talk with friends or family far away . @ CAPS4 keeps us together and gets I am not saying that @ CAPS4 ' s always a good thing , because we all need face to face interaction . Although when you are not able to get that , it is a good way to talk . To conclude , computers positivly effect our lives . We ' re able to get hand - eye coordination , and stay organized when @ CAPS4 can be a trouble to do @ CAPS4 can bring people together when they are not in person .

9262,1575,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , I am writing to you to talk about the effect computers have on people . Since I have two computers and one laptop I have to agree that every person who likes to look up stuff should have a computer . Everyone should have computers , because you can look up different things , you can play games like checkers with the computer or against somebody else , and the last reason @ CAPS1 that you can chat with people from different states and even countries , because I know everybody likes to talk to one another . Everyone should have computers , because you can search different things . You can search places and people . Basically , you can search anything on the internet @ CAPS3 you are on the right website . One time I wanted to go on the web and look to see @ CAPS3 there was a in @ LOCATION1 .

You could play internet game checkers , solitaire and even freecall . @ CAPS3 you do not any types of games you can always go on gaming just games up there . Since I use the computer everyday onto all . When I was six years old we a driving game . Since I did not the website all I got to play was checkers on the computers but one day logged onto it and played my first driving computer game . Everyone should have a computer , because you can chat with people . Instead of always using your phone calling and texting people raising your phone bill , why not use your computer and chat all you want without wasting minutes on your cell phone . I know everybody likes to talk and text on your cell phone . Instead of doing that just go on the internet find a chatcom and start chatting or bloging with your friends . One time I ran out of minutes on my phone and I did not have internet . I asked my dad @ CAPS3 I could use the computer . He said yeah , so I went to a local chatroom on the internet . My friend had an acount there so it would be easy for us to talk all we wanted . I joined in and we chatted until @ TIME1 .

9264,636,1,"Dear local newspaper , I feel that computers are very useful to society . For example , millions of people and companies and small buisnesses require the use of computers in order to optimally run their buisness . Everyone who uses computers on a daily basis can confirm that they are very useful . In fact , computers are so useful , some schools are starting to notice . I hightly reccomend that you get aquanted with such a useful and very recognized plece of technology . Did you know that many billion - dollar companies and small buisnesses require the uses that a computer has to offer ? For example , my mother is s former - district manager of the fast - food company , @ ORGANIZATION1 . When she worked at the company , they gave her a laptop that she could use only for her work . This proves my point that companies and small buisnesses require the features of a computer to smoothly run the buisness of which they run or one employed at . The technology of computers has brought education to new . Some teachers ( including my own , @ PERSON1 ) have taken the initiative to incorporate the modern technology of computers into their teachings . Classes have even been created in schools because of the popularity of computers . For example , at my school , a computer education ( or , comp , for short ) class has been created for kids to understand the knowledge and skills using a computer can give to them in the real - world . In my opinion , I it is great that computers are incorporated in so many places . Computers are used by millions of people every day . Such buisnesses are corporate like @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 are starting to see the brilliance in using computers in their company .

9266,1710,1,"would not you agree that computers have a great affect on people . The three reason why they have a good affect on people is because , it gives you good typing skills , it is educational , and it helps you out with alot of things . The first reason why computers have a good affect on people is because computers help your typing skills . If you have a computer you will soon learn that your typing skills get very good . Each time you use the computer your hands ajust to the keys on the computer . Say if there is someone that wants to work with computers when they get older , we will if they practice their typing on their computers at home they will be eligible for the job working with computers . Also computers could be good for the hearing impared . If the hearing impared use to the computers then they can get a @ CAPS1 or @ CAPS2 and chat with people online . This would be useful to them because since they could not hear what people say they can read what people say through the internet . Another reason why computers have a good affect on people is because they are very educational . In my opinion , computers are very educational because there are alot of websites that teach you facts about different places . For example , what food people eat in different countrys , or where that country is . A website that is the best for finding out accurate facts is www . Ask . com . Ask . com is the best website because it tells you what ever you want to know in a matter of seconds . Computers are also educational when it comes to school projects because of these amazing websites . The last reason why computers have a affect on people is because they help you with alot of things . They help you with alot of things because if you want to know how far @ LOCATION2 is from @ LOCATION1 then you can go on your pc and find out , or say that you lost the directions to your friends house and your on your way to their house if you brought your labtop you can go on the labtap and find where her house is from your labtop .

Know your probably saying in your heads why do not you text / call @ CAPS3 / @ CAPS4 if you think about it what if your friend does not talk clearly .

9268,1200,1,"Dear local newspaper , @ CAPS1 it has been brought to my attention that why on a nice sunny day like this somebody would want to be inside . The sad truth is that too many people are wasting their time inside on their computers , rather than enjoying the day . Computers are negatively affecting the @ LOCATION1 @ LOCATION1 population . We are getting to a point where our whole world might be absolutley crazy if nothing is done about this . For one the @ LOCATION1 has the most obese children in the world . Generally children should be running around burning off their calories ; even some people in their teen years should . Instead kids are sitting in front of computer screens on their virtual games and emails and such . Even doing chores around the house could bring down the obesity rate a lot more then sitting on your butt staring at a screen all day . The whole screen thing brings me to my next point . Staring at those bright flashy lights for too long is not good for your brain , what computers cause @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 child ceizures a year . The radioactivity in a computer could also mess you up a lot by giving you cancer , with no cure for any cancer yet you have to figure that everytime you are on that computer for too long you are putting your life at risk . The longer you are on the more and more and more radiation is going to you are brain . Do you really want to cut your life short knowing you are the one that did it to yourself , it could almost be called suicide because if you are reading this than you have been warned . So we have basically covered the effects that computers have on your body physically . The computer can also effect you mentally and socially . When @ DATE1 comes along you will have all the time in the world to be on the computer but did you know over vacation you lose @ PERCENT1 of everything you learned in school . it is been proven that computers cause memory loss . So what if you get back to school and you can not keep up with what is going on , frustrating is not it ? If you would have just read a book during the time you were on the computer maybe you could have gained knowledge rather than using it . Computers can affect you socially because not everybody wants to sit inside on the computer so while people are out having fun , you will be all alone , by yourself with nobody to talk to but a computer , would you like a computer to be your only friend ? The debate about this topic could rage on and on for days and still have no winner but in all honesty when you go to turn on that computer think to yourself , is it really worth it ? Think of everything you would lose , everything you could never get back , or would you rather do something that you would gain from in the future . it is your choice but be responsible enough to make the one that would benefit you .",9.0,245,4.364868376715565,22.65217391304348,23,0.4693486590038314,5.0,1.6015325670498084,1.0666152167384504,0.017241379310344827,23.0

Below , I will explain each reason . Firstly , it is very educational . Computer are like a giant resource of information . Many teachers @ MONTH1 direct their students online @ CAPS2 learning purposes . Also , alot of people go online to research information @ CAPS2 their school , job , or a project . Great websites that are packed with information , like @ ORGANIZATION1 , can only be accessed using a computer . @ CAPS2 example imagine having to do your research using only books , but you live far @ CAPS6 a library . The internet makes that research very easy , as you access to @ CAPS7 any time ! Secondly , they make things very easy to do . Computer provide people with many easy , convieniant ways to do many tasks . If there were not any computers in the world . do not you think that interacting with people around the world would be challenging ? Almost all of the @ CAPS4 / @ CAPS5 in the @ LOCATION2 like @ PERSON1 ' s , @ ORGANIZATION2 , or @ PERSON2 ' s have an online website to aid shoppers & they even allow them In buy things online , which is way more easy than going by car . I remember a time when I wanted to by something @ CAPS6 a store all the way in @ LOCATION1 I went online at home and bought @ CAPS7 there ! Also , @ CAPS7 makes things like ordering @ CAPS8 , getting plane tickets , getting help alot much easier & @ CAPS7 saves time ! Thirdly , computers are very enjoyable ! They provide alot of @ CAPS17 things to do ! @ CAPS2 example if you are bored you can get on computer , & search @ CAPS2 a game you enjoy . There is always a game you will like . On of all of that , you enjoy @ CAPS7 by talking to your friends and Family . You stay in touch , while enjoying their company . Another good thing that people enjoy about these computers is because they can send things to one another , lightining @ CAPS10 because of email . Imagine that you do not have a phone , and you wanted to tell your husband that is away on a business trip , that you son is very sic . If you send @ CAPS7 by mail , @ CAPS7 take at least @ NUM1 days . By email , only a couple minutes so , you can see that computer also can provide some @ CAPS11 of safety @ CAPS2 everybody ! So , as you can see computers have a very positive effect on people @ CAPS13 ways that they do this is that they are educational & they help @ CAPS1 learn . They make things like ordering @ CAPS8 , getting tickets , or contacting helpl very easy @ CAPS15 , they are very enjoyable , @ CAPS6 playing @ CAPS17 games , to staying in touch with your Friends and Family . do not you think that without computers we should probably suffer ?

In past experiences I have learned that if you get interested in computer game it will come very addicting . Computer put negative affects on people of all and I think we should stop and think about what we are doing . Most likely if you stay on the computer all day you will indeed on activities such as sports . @ CAPS2 example @ PERCENT1 of americans play soccer . In the beatiful fall when the leaves are beatifully changing you will miss out on playing soccer and the beaty of the leaves because of the computer you can not get your eyes off of . Another breathtaking adventure that you @ MONTH1 miss out on is hiking . Hiking can be amazing when you get to the top and you see on the houses that have people like you ( cach potatoes ) sitting inside on the computer . Simple activities can be lost because of an addicting game you call fun . The computer is like a cause and effect . You @ MONTH1 think you just playing farm town or chating on facebook , but in feture you will be missing out on the beauty of nature and sports . To connect @ CAPS1 ' s with missing out on sports because of the computer that will cause you to become over weight .

You @ MONTH1 be thinking how , but I have a friend named named , @ PERSON1 and he used to love to play out side and play sports until came out @ CAPS2 the computer . Now he way @ NUM1 pounds and he is only @ NUM2 . Honestly sitting in a chair all day will cause you to not be active and gain weight . Do you want this to happen to you ?

9276,128,1,"@ ORGANIZATION1 , In my opinion computers can be entertaining and educational , but should not replace everyday living . Therefore I think that computers harm people and effect them in ways they do not realize . Three reasons that support my decision are the difference between reality and fantacy , family and friends , and your health . Many children and young adults are vulnerable to the assumtion that everything you see on the computer is true . we will , as some find out it is everything but that . The addictive games and electronic features lead you to believe that the people or @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 you see are real life situations and activities . Computers are showing kids the wrong mind frame they need to be in . It affects school work and how they behave . They need to be in the right state of mind and get back to reality . Your family and friends have always been there for you . By your side even through your worst . Unfourtunetly , this addiction to the computer has brought you farther away from them . They are not happy with the way you treat them . They want a change so you can enjoy life again . Interact with a human being , not some graphic designed computer picture . that is all it is anyway , and that picture is not going to be there for you . Your family and friends last longer than that . Your body is special and your health is important . A computer @ MONTH1 suggest exercise but you are not going to really do it . You know that and the people who make computer sites know that . Your going to stay there and burn your eyes out from looking at a screen all day . It is not healthy for you or anyone else . Moving you fingers and pushing buttons is not exercise . Your already sitting anyway , so you are not doing anything helpful to yourself . You need to go outside and breathe in air and be in nature . Run around or play a bill game , but not on the computer . In conclusion , you can see how a computer can effect a person .

But , I believe that our town should not support advances in technology . You will have more time to exercise , talk to family and friends in person and to take part in different activities around the town . Do you want to be overweight and not be in shape ? we will , if you sit at the computer all day every day , you will become like that . "" I think exercise shoud be a part of everybody ' s day , "" @ CAPS1 teacher @ PERSON1 from @ LOCATION1 stated . You would be so attatched to your computer , that you would not work out . In the state of @ LOCATION1 , it is proven that @ PERCENT1 of residents are overweight from not exercising and @ PERCENT2 are overweight by not eating properly . This shows more people in @ LOCATION1 do not exercise than not eating properly . @ CAPS4 wants to be overweight and you can change that ! More people each year make facebook and @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 . Some kids in school are on the internet all day talking to friends who live down the street . Students refuse to talk to their friend on the phone . Instead , they do it online . "" @ CAPS4 can understand their tone of the message sent , "" @ PERSON3 stated . You could interpret it in different ways . When you are on the phone , it is a quick and easy way to communicate not waiting for somebody to type back . If you are a person who is always on the computer , plan a get together with your friend to talk in real life . Sidewalk sales , clubs , sports teams , holiday stroll , these are events that every town offers ! Instead of sitting dreaming of being on the team , go out and do it ! Each town cares about it is residents and want them to have fun . That is why towns offer these activities . "" @ CAPS5 want to make the town interasting and everybody to know each other , "" says @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 @ PERSON2 . If you participate in these activities , you will meet other kids your age around the town . If your town offers all of these activities , they are helping you out . Being out helping the town is way better than sitting in your house on the computer ! In many ways both advancing technology or not , why be inside doing nothing but talking to people ? Go and talk to them in real life . Being in shape , talking to people in real life and activities your town offers is the way to go .

They help people find lost fmaily members , and they help police officers find many criminals . have not you lost soemone in your family , or have not spoken to them in years and always wanted to find them and get back in with them ? we will that is what computer are for .

If you yourself while you are on the comp [ puter you would start to see that you are typing fastre and learning where all the letters are on the keyboard now , then when you saw your first computer .

Now , do not get me wrong , @ CAPS3 not saying that computer do not their downs and that people do not take advantage of computers . but , I am saying that they help society alot .

9279,68,1,"Dear Local Newspaper @ CAPS1 , I am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people . I believe that there can be both good and bad effects . Computers make things easier for people , but they are also too dependent on . Man - kind should use books for research also not just computers . Computers are very helpful for people . For example , if you really wanted to see a certain movie but you do not want to stand in line , people can go to movie tickets . com and purchase their tickets . Then , once you get to the movie theater , all that is left to do is walk over to the kiosk and redeem your tickets . Another example is that computers allow people to pay their taxes . There is special software that is able to be downloaded onto your computer . Once the software has been installed , it will usually lead you , step by step , through the process of paying your bills . it is much faster and much easier than paying "" manually "" . These are some really good effects that computers have on people . Computers also have their flaws . Over time , computers have caused most people to be lazy . Some people have become too dependant on their computers . Business owners , or businessmen and women in general , are @ CAPS2 on their laplops or blackberries . Everywhere you look there is another adult on the internet or e - mail . Not only adult ' s do this though . Students are becoming more dependant on the internet . For every assignment practically , students use google or bing . Sometimes they use or wikipedia . Students should just take the time to use their extbooks . The student body would rather watch @ CAPS3 , play video games , or text than do homework . This is understandds because homework can be boring but it all pays off in the end . Taking the extra @ NUM1 minutes to use a textbook will not kill anyone . No one has died yet from using a book instead of google . Also , in using a textbook , you will understand how to do whatever you are doing . That is not so bad , is it ? Computers , as you can see , have both good and bad effects . it is easy to use the internet for homework but that does not really help you . Making purchases is fun though . It saves gas money and time .

Computers are very helpful in every one ' s daily life they have so many facts and interesting things on them , @ CAPS2 about again trying to figure out were someone lives it is very easy , go on google and type in someones ' s adress and there you go . The @ CAPS3 is also very good because have you ever thought about one of your friends or a special someone and you have not seen them in like a really long time and you miss them we will no problem mostley all computers have some sort of camera in them were you could video chat or just chat regular on the enternet . That is very helpful because even though you could just go on the phone and call them it is better to do it online because how about if you have not seen them you want to see a picture of them they could just send it to you on some sort of chat page or just your email . It is so much better then mailing one picture in the mail and it takes days for the mail to come if you could do it the faster way on line and on video chat it will be better . The @ CAPS3 is also very helpful because how about one day you want to go some were and you do not know what the weather is going to be we will you could go to put on the tv and see but there is so many communications and you can not really see because they move the weather days fast . On the @ CAPS3 you could type the weather in for one week and it will tell you and you could look at it for as long as you want and it will stay there so you could see the whole week without the screen having fast as the image is not in the light light or if it is to dark . The @ CAPS3 is so helpful . People do say that it is good to get off the @ CAPS3 and go for a walk outside in nature I do agree with that but people and children do get their exercising by walking around the house and going outside going shopping . Computers are helpful and nice and another thing is say one day you are online and you are looking at clothes or shoes and you want to buy them but you do not want to go to the mall a half hour away from were you live you could just buy them online and they will be shipped to your house and you do not even have to lift a fingure . They are also good because they have like a dictionary on it were if you do not know how to spell a word you type it in the best way you can and it corrects your spelling and tells you what the word is , also the computers have pictures of everything , if you want to see how something looks like you can type it in and shows you . with all the facts I have given you I hope you agree with me that computers are very helpful nice and safe .",9.0,203,3.5289422619334765,44.92307692307693,13,0.34700854700854694,4.0,1.4393162393162393,0.3912435636292557,0.013675213675213677,13.0
9282,907,1,"Dear newspaper and readers of @ LOCATION1 , I am @ PERSON1 , a student from @ ORGANIZATION1 , I have recently been enformed about the argument over computer use and I feel it is silly . We need computers in life to help us do jobs , communicate with family or friends traveling the world , and for research on homework . First of all , without computers many people would struggle . My father uses a computer for his job and he could not do his job without one . Sure , many people spend way to much time on their computer , but other people use it to save information or find research . I know people argue that computers should be used less , but could you get through a week without using one computer ? Most people could not , especially if you own a buisness . In addition , from using computers for jobs , some people like to chat online with a friend that move away . Imagine if your family member or friend traveled constantly and they went to places where they could not get connection on their cell phone , the only way to talk to them is chating through the web . I am sure everyone has used a computer once to talk to a friend or for something related to buisness , so they are more useful than people relize . Lastly , as a kid we need to be able to use a computer , not just to talk to friends but for homework . Some homework requires us to make powerpoints , write a paper on historical facts , and we need computers to do so . Without computers , kids would not be able to gather facts or information to write a paper . Decreasing computer use for kids can potentialy bring down their grades . My teacher always says , "" grades are the most imfortant thing . "" I am sure all parents would agree with that . All in all , we can not decrease the use of computers because it can do damage to peoples lives . Think about people who travel alot , kids with work that needs to be done , and parents with jobs that they need computers for , do not upset all of these people by decreasing computer time .

I like to shop online for discounts and sales where I know thing are cheaper than in stores . I know my brother likes to go to concerts and buy himself the latest video games .

9285,1264,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 , Computers do not have a positive effect on people . Thanks to computers people arn ' t being active as much , enjoying nature , or interacting with family and friends . One reason this is true is because people are not exercising , they are too busy playing on the computers . People are gaining weight , which is already a problem in the @ LOCATION1 because of unnecissary technology . There are plenty of sports that could be done , such as soccer , baseball , football , and so many more . People seemed to manage fine without computers and were a lot more active before them . Another reason computers do not have a positive effect on people is because they do not go out and enjoy nature . People spend too much time looking up beautiful place and animals when they could easily go explore around outside ! Take a walk by the forest or in a local park , even by the beach and you will see loads of animals . Not to mention , the immense amount of different plants and flowers they have never noticed right behind their very own home ! No computers and people could quickly start enjoying nature more often . Thirdly , a reason why computers arn ' t positive on people is because they are not interacting with other people . Some people are too busy on facebook or myspace , e - mailing or @ CAPS3 - ing each other . Sometimes they arn ' t even talking to who they believed they were , it not only dangerous but unhealthy also . what is wrong with giving someone far away a call ? You can actually hear their voice and know it is them on the other line ! it is rediculous how people will e - mail a friend that is down the street . It would be much simpler and healthier to just walk over to their house . The two of you can chat and take a walk , or play a game , not just sit infront of a screen the whole day .

9287,342,1,"Dear editor : More and more people use computers , but not everyone agrees that that benefits society . As editor of the newspaper , you have the power to inform people about situations . In my opinion computers are desperately in need because of the following : the computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places , people , and weather , they allow people to talk online with others , and many jobs use computers . Do you want a more economically advanced state ? First of all the computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places , people , and the weather . I have an uncle named @ PERSON1 , that has @ NUM1 little girls . Every day in the morning before school @ PERSON1 checks on the weather , on his computer to make sure it is safe to go school . However , one day forgot to check the weather on his computer and took his kids to school . Little did he know the roads were extremely icey . Sadly @ PERSON1 and his daughters got in a car accident and two of girls broke a few bones . As you can see , the weather the computer world have saved him a trip to the emergency room . Next , the computer allows you to talk online with other people . Dr . @ DR1 from @ CAPS1 states says that , "" chating online with others ( @ CAPS2 ) is the best way to stay in touch with others from your old school , camp and many other places . "" I highly agree because adults can stay in touch with freinds from middle school . Also @ PERCENT1 of students say that they usually go online to study or get the pages for homework . I believe that chating online to study for tests is a fantastic idea because it will help the students to get better grades . Some parents say that that is a way to study and a waste of time . However teachers say that ever since @ CAPS2 was invented the students grades were skyrocketing . Finally most jobs today use computers . For example my dad works for @ ORGANIZATION1 and the computer helps him communicate with clients all over the world . Also the chat can translate the language , thus it makes it much easier than talking on the phone . Also the teachers use computers to put grades from students in . This makes the teachers job much easier because it averages all of the grades . The computer revolutionise the jobs of people . In conclusion the computer has a positive effect on people because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places , people , and weather , allows people to talk online with other people , and many jobs use computers .

9288,261,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , I believe many people spend to much time on computers . It is okay to be on a computer for twenty minutes , to a half an hour . But one hour or more , is too long . People could get sucked in by playing adicting games . Also by online chatting survices like facebook , myspace , instant messaging , and more . Another way , I think someone could spend more time on a computer is working on a report . They might start it lost minute . These are just same of the many ways someone could be sucked into their computers . Have you ever hopped on the computer and played a game ? Then you look at the time and it is an hour later ? Games are very adicting . you can play a game for hours and not notice how much time has passed by . Games are very fun , but they fry your brain . @ PERCENT1 of the human population spends up to an average of two hours on a computer each day . I think , we should eliminate some games off the internent , so people can spend days exercising and hanging out with friends , not playing silly games . Have you ever started a conversation with someone and realized you have been talking for an hour and a half ? And that you have homework ? @ PERCENT3 of teenages on average spend three hours each day chatting with friends on the internent . Facebook , myspace , instant messaging are all examples of this . It is okay for someone to talk to their friends , but you need to watch the time so you do not get carryied away . I think , we shoud cut down out use on these websites , so children and teenagers can get their homework done . Have you ever been assigned a report and wait till the last minute to get it started ? Many teenagers do this . They wait and start their reports the day before their reports are due . They then , are stuck on the internent for hours trying to get it done . Which makes their grade lower then if they were to start it earlyier . @ PERCENT2 of students wait till last minute to do their reports , on average , they spend over four hours on the computer . I think we should make sure that students start their report earlyier so it could bring up their grades . In conclusion i believe people have spent way to much time using computers , due to games , internent chatting , and reports being done last minute . I think if we elimate games off the internent , cut down use on internent chatting , and start reports earlyier , people will start exercising , hanging out with friends and family , get homework done and get higher grades .",9.0,186,4.748025002815699,14.833333333333336,30,0.4170403587443946,6.0,1.5762331838565022,1.4746786893334003,0.02466367713004484,30.0

Computers improve our hand - eye coordinations typing is a good way to improve this vital skill by not looking and knowing which buttons are where . Using a mouse is also a good to improve by moving the digital mouse with the one in your hand . This can improve foster writing , because you are moving the friend in your hand the same way you would move a mouse or type . This can also help driving , because you can not look at the wheel , you have to keep your eyes on the word , and in order to do that you most know how you are moving the wheel . Computers can help hand - eye coordination which can help with writing and driving , with typing and and moving a mouse . Computers can increase our knowledge about faraway places , and people .

Learning about different cultures can teach us many things . Like what kind of clothes they wore , food they ate , place the , lived in .

9293,1665,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , Advances in computer technology have positively affected the society we live in today . Computers teach hand - eye coordination , help kids learn inside and outside of school , and connect the world socially . These amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation . In fact , they have done quite the opposite . Computers are an excellent way of teaching hand - eye coordination . People who are opposed to using computers believe that all they do is make kids lazy and ignorant . This is not the case . The coordination gained from using the mouse games over to sports like baseball and lacross . Players have to look at an incoming ball , and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball . As you can see , coordination is essential to sports . It is also needed for simple every day tasks around the house . These could be as plain as just taking out the trash or cooking meals . We overlook the fact they easy jobs like these still require coordination . A misplaced pot could pour boiling water on the floor and cause a huge mess . W are lucky that we live in a world with such a good teacher of hand - ey coordination . Computers are the worlds most knowledgeable teachers . No matter how hard you try if you are using a computer , you will learn something . The internet is a best cache of information . In the current day and age , the environment is a growing concern . Paper no made from trees , so must be cut down . It takes forty years for a tree to grow , and seconds to cut one down . Schools everywhere should use computer and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil . Since most students are familiar with computers , they enjoy working with them more than writing . The average kid could learn more in an hour with a computer than they would whole day at school . The transiton needs to be made . Computers are also a massive social network . Instant messaging and @ CAPS2 are now primary sources of communication . If it has not for computers , I would not be able to talk to my friend that moved to @ LOCATION2 two years ago . This is just one example of how social networks are helpful . They help people stay connected with old friends , and work . All major corporations use computers to invest , sell products , and store information . Computers are the ultimate way communicate . Obviously , computers are growing exponentially in popularity . The @ LOCATION1 should put this to use . Imagine a more eco - friendly country where we do not have to cut down a million acres of @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 rainforest every year . The benifits of computers are endless . Three of these are hand - eye coordination , knowledge and communication .",9.0,259,5.102904329598451,12.216216216216214,37,0.5717439293598234,6.0,1.6777041942604856,1.4443364115472177,0.019867549668874173,37.0

Parents argue that kids wagh more because they sit inside on the computer , but if they do sertain things to limit the @ CAPS2 like only goind on sertain games , limiting there time on the computer , or making them play outside the same amount of time they were on the computer the kids could be learning while still staying fit . This is why a computer could be a way important part of a childs life if used properly . What is you method of learning ? Maybe you read books , go to school or even watch @ CAPS3 . But what if you arn ' t at school , or have any books around ? What if your @ CAPS3 is not telling you what yo need to know ? we will , with a computer you can look up almost anything with just few clicks of a button . If you do not have time to take a trip to you local library to a book , @ CAPS1 would you learn ? As teen who attends school I know that I would not be able to do a lot of my school work and projects without my computer . A lot of the at home jobs today require computers , and without the computers the job would not be getting done . This is why I think computers benifit our society and knowledge . Does everyone you know live in one are ? Probably not this is why websites like @ CAPS5 and @ CAPS6 are getting more and more members each day . Ther internet helps us keep intuch with relatives friends and ever helps us meet new people .

Even some people do online education . Also what a lot of people like about computers is the games . Computers are a great benifit to us and can be useful and fun . The computer can teach us many new and exciting things . There can be a lot to learn too . Somethings you could learn about on the computer are places , people , animals , plants , food , etc . I have once had to find a recipe for carmel apples and to do so I used the computer . Some people use the computer for there education . There are online college and online high school . it is like a new way to be home schooled . Not everyone can go to big @ CAPS1 so it is easier for them to use an online college . Also , lets say your doing a project and you need information instead of rushing to the library you can use the computer and find it . There are many other things you can do on the computer like visit some friends . I friends , everyone has friends either new friends or old friends . Back then before computers if you wanted to talk to your friend you would have had to send a letter . With computer you can now send a letter faster then before . it is now called an email . Which you just type what you want and click . send it off to your friend . Not all use an email , some use instant messaging . An example of that would be aim or meebo . I moved from @ LOCATION1 to hear and I have friends I do not get to see much . I bet there are many people that have that same issue . we will with the computer you can now see people ! chat and see them . For instance @ ORGANIZATION2 is a way to see your friends like that . it is a easy and fun way to stay in touch with friends and even you family . There is still more that a computer can do . Another thing it can do is play video games . They are so much fun to play and what I am talking about is video games . Kids them even teens and adults love . Whenever your bored you can go play online games . Or you can have games you purchesed and play them . They are entertaining and fun too ! Even very little kids can play games .

Kids should know what is going on in the world , or you could be a adult just browsing the web loking for information . My point is tons of people all around the world computers to learn . My last reason is to teach kids to type and to have hand eye cordination when kids get older and when we get @ CAPS3 they are gonna need to learn how to type . So odds are if you do not know how to type you will not get very far but there in the real world .

Some people have a job that includes computers so they could also read the newspaper on their computer while also working . This benefits sociaty it is own way . I believe computers are very useful to everyone . C omputers can help people get in touch . They can keep in touch by using webcam and etc . It could also let them communicate . Computers allow people to see each other from different places in the world . It gives people a chanve to see the people you could not see from afar . In my opinion people can also learn from computers . Computers have many positive effects that are very important . They give people a chance to learn things .

It seems to me that they are used way too much in people ' s lives , and that computers are distractions that do not allow people to di ceratin things in their life that they would if they weren ' t always on the computer . People ' s lives are starting to revolve around going on the computer , checking your facebook , and looking at new videos on @ CAPS2 . com . I know from experience facebook or myspace can be very addicting . I will spend hours commenting on pictures or new wall posts , and then at @ NUM1 pm I had realized I have not begun any of my loads of homework . This happens quite often , and I end up staying awake until around @ NUM2 . The following moring I wake up at @ NUM3 am , exhausted . I am not exaggerating either , this happens to many of my friends , and if you have kids , ask them because I am @ PERCENT1 sure they are on facebook or @ CAPS3 all night . This does not just happen with kids either , my mom just got a facebook and she is hooked to it , even more than I am . Sometimes it can be come a competition to see who has the most pictures , or the most friends . Kids start adding people as friends that they do not even know computers are not just distractions , they are also very dangerous . At my school we had assembly where they showed us how easy it was to find out someone ' s personal information , Even if you do not have your address or your phone number listed , there are many other ways to track you down . If you take a picture right after you won the championship soccer game , in your jersey . Just that one picture shows your team name , your last name , and your number . Anyone could easily search all that stuff on the internet and know exactly where your next game be . As the local newspaper @ CAPS1 , I am sure you must be concerned about the safety of the town , or even your own kids . Some people @ MONTH1 say "" that would never happen to me "" but it easily could , especially if you are constantly on your computer . I have noticed that a lot of teens around my age are starting to become obsessed with being on the computer . A lot of times in families , instead of spending time together . syblings are fighting over who gets to go on the computer . One sybling @ MONTH1 need it for homework , while the other just wants to talk to her friends on @ CAPS3 and each believes they deserves the computer . Computers are starting to interest a lot with people ' s lives , in a negative way . Once again they are distracting , dangerous and hurt families . Computers hurt society more than it helps .

You can type you can plan your sedual . You can make a presantation or check your email . All of those things make work easier . And there are tons of more things you can do . As I said before they can help people learn . You can learn trillions of things on the internet . You can learn about everything on the internet and it is quite amazing . You could get a medical degree on the internet . Makeing work easyer or helping people learn are not the extent of the computers abilitys . Computers can prevent acidents in anything that moves . For example cars millions on the road today and some can practily drive them selves . And that is all done with computers . Also planes , the only reason the piolot is there is in case something gose wrong . Same thing with trains . Furthermore @ CAPS1 are completly computerized all the humans do is tell the computer what they want it to do . Almost everything that moves within it is own power has been computerized at some point in time . And that makes the world safer for every one . Finaly computers save lives , it is completly true . In hospitals without computers people would be dieing every day . They use them to keep records , record vital signs and asist with surgery . In surgery computers help by only haveing to make a tiny insision and can be much more acurate than human sergons which save lives . Also computers can mak sure that a operating room is completly sterial which reduces risks of infection . As you can see computers benifit society a lot more than you might think .

They feel they need to focus on winning and beating all their friends . To win , people can not talk , just focus on the game . Kids who need to win and not talk could lead to lifetime results . Being self - consious or having no social skills are the biggest lifetime results from being too involved in a computer game . That is how being too involved in computer games affects their social skills . Kids who are too involved in their computer games , do not get enough exrcersize causing obsity . Kids think they are getting exrcersize by playing but in reality they are doing nothing at all . Kids think they can not leave their game , but they can . there is always a pause button somewhere on the screen .

This world wold be nothing without computers . But on the other hand some people do spend to much time on the computer . But surfing the web for countless hours is their choice . Computers can help students do research from the comfort of their own home . Instead of going to the local library and looking and looking for books , all they have to do is type in thier research topic and wallah tons of different websites are right under their noses . A computer is the world at your finger tips . Also a computer can help unemployed people find a job . it is easy , type in what city you want to work in , and there you go . You can even fill out a job application right then and there . Hey , some people even work from home . Stay at home moms can easily make money while doing daily chores like washing dishes . Also working from home can a lot less tessful . it is less stressful because you do not have to deal with annoying and impatiant co . workers . Did you know that @ PERCENT1 of employment is from the workers home , @ CAPS1 now you know . Working from home makes another day at the office , another day at home .

9328,833,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , Are you spending all your precious time on a computer ? On the computer your probably wasting every second searching or playing games . You shoudn ' t spend alot of time on the computer it will just wash away your brain . You shoudn ' t go on computers for a long time because instead you should be exercising , enjoying nature and interacting with people . First of all , spending too much time on the computer is not good for you because you should be out exercising . On computers you can not jog the fat you gain by eating food . By jogging instead of going on the computer you can lose weight and see the real world than the world behind the computer screen . Nevertheless computers are fun to go on like playing addicting games . but is not it better to play a real sport like soccer . In soccer you have to use your mind and alot so it is much better than sitting or laying around dazed at a computer screen for a long period of time . do not you love playing outdoor games ! Like playing tag or hiding go seek is not that more fun than playing an addicting game on the computer screen ? For me I think it is . That is my reasons I think you should exercise then stare at the computer screen . Secondly , you should not be on the computer for a long amount of time because you should instead be enjoying nature . Nature is beautiful and refreshing unlike a computer . Yeah I know computers offer alot but do they offer the fresh air outside , the warm breeze land living animals the earth . I do not think so and neither should you . Instead of going on your computer when it is raining not you should play with your pets and if you do not have any put a raincoat umbrella and go outside . Especially in the @ DATE1 you should be outside enjoying nature go for a swim or bring your annoying little siblings to the park . There is more to often in use than going on the computer . More importantly , you should not go on the computer because you are better off . Interacting with living people in person . On the computer talking to people you are going no where on the computer chatting with people it is impossible to read someones expression . So get off the computer and hang with your family and friends . Get into a fun conversation or debate . Make new friends when your at the mall or discovering a new trail in a park . Do anything but interact on the computer when all you see is typed words writing back to you . Get your self out in the world do not just interact with people but the world not the computer screen . In conclusion you should not spend most of your precious time on the computer . It is not nessasary for you to spend all your time on the computer when you could be exrcising , enjoying nature and interacting with people . I strongly beleive people should be outside than on a computer . So what are you waiting for get off that computer and take a hike !",9.0,205,4.917964751291338,16.12121212121212,33,0.38461538461538464,6.0,1.5853658536585369,1.462103868084219,0.009380863039399627,33.0
9330,1021,1,"I think that it is fine that people spend a lot of time on the computer instead of having time to exercise , enjoy nature and interact with family and friends because it is the persons choice to either stay on the computer all day or go outside . Computers affect peoples lives in good ways and bad ways . People stay inside all day and do nothing besides sit there and just click buttons . Good ways is that it educates you in many ways because @ CAPS1 your on the computer watching or reading interesting things you could end up learning something before you learn it in school . it is good to go on the computer for a little a bit but @ CAPS1 your on it all day then you could have no exercise and become lazy and fat . But @ CAPS1 you go outside sometimes you will not have to worry because you are getting exercise that helps out your body . I think computers are a great way to have fun . You can chat with your friends , @ CAPS1 you have a webcam you can video chat with friends . A cmputer is a great way for communication . Millions of people use a computer for working at their @ CAPS2 . Without computers life would be ten times harder for people in this world . People like accountants use computer for there job . They store data into the computer to remember things @ CAPS1 you could not write it down on a piece of paper , People also make websites on the internet to help educate , like @ CAPS1 you type in a word it could give you a definition , People also make @ CAPS4 engines , @ CAPS4 engines are some engine on a website that searches for things you type in . @ CAPS1 you type in something you will get what you were looking for . My whole point of explaining this is that it is the peoples choice @ CAPS1 they would like to be on all the time . Because computers and internet connections arn ' t free . It does not even do anything bad to your brain . It mostly educates it . People even go to school online they learn and study on things that are on the internet . Plus you could get @ CAPS2 at places for working with computers , You could make programs , and anything you would want . So my statement here is that it is okay to spend alot of time on your computer instead of exercizing going to see friends and family and enjoy nature . I think that computers are fine and it does not matter how long your on it , it just depends @ CAPS1 your learning and not playing games all day and being lazy and get fat .",9.0,190,4.153414376676329,20.272727272727273,22,0.4250559284116331,5.0,1.5682326621923937,1.47283015230032,0.013422818791946308,22.0

9332,314,1,"I believe computers are not having a positive effect on people in this time period for some people they have really taken over their lives . There are many health concerns that take place in a generation full of computers . Also there is less time in your schedule for more important things when you are adicted to facebook . Also money will always be less when computers come along ! Computers can really be dangerous to you health ! For example all that typing can lead to arthritis in the hands and fingers in the long run . Did you know , more seizure are induced by compexors than epileptics ? Dr . @ LOCATION1 is as saying "" People do not cause obesity , computers do "" @ CAPS1 also thinks that the majority of the obeisity is caused by an addiction to computer games . Ever been depressed than taken a long nature walk , and felt great ? we will a lot of people tell on rely on thier computer when they are down . Computers usually make things worse . When on twitter , facebook , google and you tube all the time it is hard to find time for even the most important things . For example if you are a parent your child might feel abandonned if you start caring about the computer more than very little time spent together could turn them to alchohol or smoking . I let you never of a computer like that ! Computer can be good way to wind down but they can also become an addiction there when you are addicted to sitting on a computer you forget about the beauty of nature ! Money can also contribute to the addiction . For example shopping addictions are a good way to blow money because it is so easy . All you have to do is type in a credit card number which gives you the illusion that you are not spending money , until the bill comes ! Another thing is kids websites like webking which you need to pay for you also need to pay for internet and the electricity bill . it is clear to see that computers cause nothing but health problems , less time in your daily schedule and the money out of you pocket .

Let ' s say you are a middle @ CAPS4 student that has been assigned to write a paper on a designated topic ; @ CAPS2 instead of spending hours upon hours looking for the right information in a library , you could just google search what your topic in and @ CAPS3 ! You have exactly what you need to know in front of you within seconds , prettty cool right ? Still do not believe computers are helpful ? What if I told you @ CAPS1 allowed students to do better in @ CAPS4 ? that is right , computers allow students to do better in @ CAPS4 . Websites such as edline allow teachers to post their students grades very quickly . How is this helpful ? When you take a quiz your treacher has to grade over @ NUM1 quizzes ! And with things like absentees , weekends and vacations , the day you get your quiz back gets delayed further . Sometimes kids do not get their quizzes back for two weeks after they took them ! By the time you get @ CAPS1 back @ CAPS1 ' s time for a chapter test with @ PERCENT1 of your grade and you just found out you did not do @ CAPS2 on one of the sections ! This lowers your ability to do @ CAPS2 on the test . But if your grade was posted on the internet days before , you will have more time to study and know what to study and you will do @ CAPS2 on the test . As you can see , computers are very helpful for students , but are they good for teachers too ? The answer is yes , computers are a good teaching tool . Has this ever happened to you ? No matter how much your teacher explains to you , @ CAPS1 just seems like there are speaking another language ? @ CAPS2 what if they showed you a cool video on youtube explaining @ CAPS1 ? Would you learn better with a visual in front of you ? I sure would . Computers are also great for teachers because @ CAPS1 gives them the ability to email other teachers if there is a problem and get the latest information about the @ CAPS4 and what is going on . Do you understand why computers are useful , now ? I hope you realize how useful computers are because they make learning easier , allow students to do better in @ CAPS4 , and are a great learning tool . These are only some of the many reasons computers are useful and I hope you keep using them in our community .",10.0,228,4.628329721859581,17.379310344827587,29,0.4514851485148515,5.25,1.5564356435643565,1.4741227078131964,0.0198019801980198,29.0
9350,1350,1,"Dear Newspaper @ CAPS1 , With computers being so popular right now it is easy to think that they are helpful and have a positive effect on the people that use them . However , I do do belive that computers have more harmful effects than good ones on the people they are used by . I belive this for @ NUM1 reasons . One , they take away from spending time with real people , they make people get less excersis , and also they are very distracting and waste time . One reason why I do not think computers have a positive effect on people is that the time spent on the computer could be put to better use by doing things with family and friends . Now and day people are using social networking sites like @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3 to talk with people far away . People can spend hours communication with someone they will never meet and completly ignore the people who care for and love them . Also communication with people online can be dangerous because the person who you are messaging might not be who they say they are . Overall , setting out and actually spending time with real people creates memories that you will cherish for the rest of your life . This feeling can never occur through the internet . Another reason why I think that computers have a bad effect on their users is that constant computer use has resulted in a lack of excersise for many people . People who use computers for many hours are just sitting still . They are not being active . The only movement that occurs while on a computer is the tiny flick of a finger as it clicks the mouse button . This is clearly not enough excersise that is required to maintain a healthy and happy lifestyle . Studies have shown that since the invention of computers young people especially have been gretting less and less physical activity . I am sure that this will continue to get worse if people continue spending a majority of time on their computers . A third reason why I think computers are having a negative effect on people is because they are distracting and they waste time . An example of this is that once when I was online doing research for a school project , I saw an advertisment for a website that looked interesting . When I clicked on it I was brought to a site full of funny stories and pictures . I spent the next half an hour reading entries on that website and completely forgot about my project . When I relized what I had done I rushed to finish my research and ended up getting a poorer grade then . I am sure I would have gotten if I had not been distracted other things to do on the computer . This is why I think computers do not have a good effect on the people who use them . They take away from spending time with family and friends , they result in less excercise . And they waste time and are distractions .",10.0,230,4.585765205085501,19.26923076923077,26,0.4581673306772908,6.0,1.6035856573705178,1.1056124005414156,0.0199203187250996,26.0

He usually is @ CAPS2 much in a rush he picks off of other people ' s @ CAPS2 they would be finished faster , when every one wants to enjoy then food . When we want to go out to the movies my brother stays home on the computer . Even if we buy a movie and whatch it at home he will not whatch it with us he is on the computer .

9352,1756,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , @ CAPS1 your computer daily can be a waste of your life . Your computer time can take away from your time spent exercsing and enjoying nature , distract you from human nature things such as communicating , and can also waste tons of energy .

Take away your computer and all you are doing is sitting thhere , not burning one calorie , or exercising one muscle , [ expect your fingers of ] @ CAPS2 ' t you think you should be doing something more usefull in your life ?

9353,1181,1,"One girl sits by her computer doing homework . Another girl with her computer , talks to her friends . Those girls are doing activitys that make our world more productive . I think that computers have a positive effect on people . Computers help people with hand - eye cordination , learn about faraway places , and talk with others online . This is what computers can do to help our socity become better . Firstly , the computer can teach us hand - eye cordination . By playing games , we can use what we learn in real life . A boy can play football on line , then take what he learned and use that in a real football game . Hand - eye cordination on the computer can help us to learn new things about our society . We could use what we learned to discover new things and help us to make the community , as a whole , These skills can also help us do more things at once . Multitasking is a difficult task to and with hand - eye cordination and computers it becomes easier . A second productive task can help us with is learning . Some people do not know going on in The computer can direct us to news The computer is literally like one huge look of use . Another positive effect that computers have on people is communication . Many people have a twitter , facebook , myspce , etc . and all those websites can help . Products like skpe , video chat , aim and email allow people to have a conversation online . Email is something that there are so many new ides . You cannot only talk you can do business , send pictures , invitations , and announcements . Schools , offices , and companys all over the world use these products and it does not only make society better it makes the world better . In conclusion , computers do have a positive effect on people around the world . They can help with hand eye cordination , help you learn about far away places , and they help people communicate . That one girl doing her homeowrk get an A and the girl talking on her signs off to be with her family .",10.0,167,4.462019234938071,14.416666666666664,24,0.4812680115273775,6.0,1.6340057636887608,1.2987949406953985,0.01729106628242075,24.0
9354,1622,1,There are many reasons that computers are a good thing for the world . They let us learn about far away places without us even having to leave our homes . Another reason why computers are so important is we can talk to our family without having to even travel if they live in another country or another state or even if they are your neighbors . Lastly they teach us hand - eye cordination that is a much needed skill that can help you get through life . The fantastic thing about computers are that we can learn about far away places without having to leave the comfort of our home . People of all different countries @ MONTH1 be inquestitive about where they came from . They @ MONTH1 also wonder how other countries are doing goverement wise or even economic ( stocks ) . All of this is possible and much quicker then watching the news or weather channel . Computers allow us to search the web and arm ourselves with knowledge . The marvelous things about computers is the speed of them . You could be waiting for a stock update on the news channel and wait maybe ten or even twenty minutes . However if you go on your computer and use the internet it makes you life much easier and the faster you can look up somes part of knowledge the faster you might be able to make dinner or even enjoy a nice walk outside and breathe in the nice icy crisp cold air . Also radios and television stations might be a little of with their accuaracy . Maybe a minute later there is a suicide bombing that you might like to know about or the stock might go up one - hundred points or go down one - hundred points . This is all valuable information that people would want to be one - hundred percent accurate . Secondly you can stay in touch with your family even if they live in a different country or in a different state . With webcams that are attachable to some computers or some that are embedded within the computers you can talk to them . My grandma was in the hospital once and I was not allowed to see her since I was to young . Since the technology of webcams were invented I was able to see her on the screen instead of seeing her in real life but at least i was able to see if she was doing okay . Webcams are a could way also in discussions . Such as you and your friend are joking and she says something you think is rude but you can not tell that she being sarcastic you might get into a fight . If you have a webcam you can talk to eachother on the computer and see if she is being sarcastic or not . Technology @ MONTH1 be one of the greatest inventions that has come forth and @ MONTH1 be the best one that will ever be made . That last important thing that you need to know about computers is that they teach you hand - eye cordination . Hand - eye cordination is an important skill that is acquired . This is an important skill because it allows you to suceed in life such as having to write . This skill is also important if you have a job that invloves computers because you need to know how to type and move you fingers fast if you want to suceed in this we will payed job . This skill also helps provide a wide range of other suceesful jobs in the world . Computers in the long run are magnificent machines that makes life a lot easier and fun in acquiring knowledge . If you do not have a good hand - eye cordnation you should get a computer because it will help a lot . however if you get a computer you must update it reguarly so you computer will not become slow and start crashing on you . In conclusion computers are the best thing that has been introduced to man kind so far in this world . It allows you to do do many things such as news and how the world is doing globally and how the economy is doing globally . Also it allows you to stay in touch with your family no matter how far you live or what country that you life in . Lastly computers teach you the important skill of hand - eye cordnation . Everyone in the world should be able to have a computer so that they could obtain the knowledge that they would nedd to suceed in life .,10.0,292,5.047750130605476,20.944444444444443,36,0.3867549668874172,5.0,1.557615894039735,1.0848840292766129,0.007947019867549669,36.0
9355,289,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , The effect that computers have on people is not a positive one . I think people spend way too much time on computers , some information on computers is inaccurate , there are still telephones and cellphones that people can use fir communication . A majority of peoples ' time is spent on the computer . Whether it is playing games , checking @ CAPS2 - mail , or even working , peoples ' valuable time is getting used up . This time could be used by doing more important things such as being with friends and family , being outside with nature or exercising . Being on the computer insteads of exercising has had a huge effect on people . Some people are overweight because they eat and then do not exercise after . My sister works on the all day and she says @ NUM1 or @ NUM2 ladies at her work are un healthy because all they do is go on the the computer and eat granola bars , wich are usually healthy . If others spent at least a half an hour being outside to @ CAPS3 some fresh air instead of using a computer most of them would feel a lot better . My doctor always used to tell me and my brother , "" @ CAPS3 out and play an hour a day ! "" This is true , and I strongly encourage people to go outside and do an activity as opposed to playing on the computer . The computer is used a lot for researching . Some of the information on the computer is very helpful , but you can never really know what information is inaccurate . At least when you research using a book or encyclopedia , you can trust those sources . What if you had to do a report and you could only use the internet , how would you be able to tell if the information is trustworthy ? Sure , computers also teach hand - eye coordination by playing video games , but when in real life , will you need to know how to shoot a dragon or dodge candy that is falling from the sky ? This is just an example of unneeded information and skills that keeps people wanting to go back on the computer . Another thing you can do on the computer is communicte with others . When computers weren ' t invented or even that advanced , people were more than happy to give one another a call . Now with computers , people @ CAPS2 - mail , instant message , or even skype ; a webcam website .

In my opinion , computers are a @ CAPS9 thing for our everyday lives . The internet allows us to communicate with friends , family , and more people around the globe ! it is various programs help keep files and other things of that nature organized and updated . Finally , computers are a @ CAPS9 resource when researching for projects , reports , homework , or anything else that requires information to complete . The world is a large place with many people , places , regions , and countries . Families sometimes move far away from their families and friends , so they want to keep in contact . Post is a very slow and costly service , while the internet is cheaper and quicker ! I am ' s , @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 , use one of these fast and cheap ways . They allow you to send a message and receive a message on any day , at anytime , in any place with little of no hassle involved . Another way is to use websites like @ CAPS3 and @ CAPS4 , which allow you to update your "" status "" on your wall so everyone on your friends list can see or comment on . The final and last way is by using a webcam , which enables you to see the person on the other end of the "" call "" and you can also hear their voices . This is the best way , in my opinion , because instead of sending text and pictures they can explain everything in their own way with no limit on how much they can say . Many people have noticed that the world is not an organized place . Computers help organize it with their many applications and programs like @ ORGANIZATION1 apps , @ CAPS5 , and document folders . @ ORGANIZATION1 is a chain of apps for everything from writing documents to making spreadsheets to making presentations and even to making fliers for special events . These apps are the basic to starting up a business or promoting an invention . @ CAPS5 mainly centers on keeping information stored an organized in files however you wish and is @ CAPS9 for quick access to them . My parents and other adults I know always say "" organization is the key to success "" , so @ CAPS5 definetly helps . The final and most basic way that computers help for organization are document folders . These little things come in handy when you need to save something quickly bu want to keep it organized . All you have to do is name it , click save , and bada bing bada boom you are done ! Most importantly , computers come in handy when researching for projects or something else that requires lots of up - to - date information . Books will take a few days and you only have @ NUM1 days to research , create , and organize your project and data . What are you gonna do now ? You could hand it in late , but then you will yet in trouble .

In conclusion , I would like to state that computers are not a good thing for society , they are a @ CAPS9 thing for civilization !

My second reason that computers are extremely good for us is that they are entertaining . On your new laptop you can go on miniclip or addicting games , both gaming websites and play games . These game while not only are fun improve handeye coordination which helps with sports , driving , writirs and many other things . More advanced gaming computers called consoles such as the @ CAPS2 - box @ NUM2 , by @ ORGANIZATION1 , the @ NUM3 , the @ CAPS3 by the @ CAPS4 provide exteme gaming experience . One of the more recent games for these consoles is called @ CAPS5 of @ CAPS6 ! Modern @ CAPS7 @ NUM4 . This game has an online system where you can talk to and play against people all around the world . Not only that but advanced games such as @ CAPS5 of @ CAPS6 improve eyesight . Studies show that playing a high action game @ NUM4 hrs a day will improve eyesight more than eating @ NUM6 serving carrots a day . My final reason that computers are good for you is that they take boring waits . If you have everyone to @ CAPS10 you know that the lime can be @ NUM4 hrs long . People used to wait that just standing there . Now people can pull out their @ CAPS11 or @ NUM8 player and listen to music . The @ CAPS11 can take videos and pictures as we will as play music , videos and games . If you are lucky enough to have an I touch you can check email , stocks , weather and news right on your @ CAPS13 as we will as buy songs which can be @ NUM9 cheaper than @ CAPS14 . In conclusion all of this advantage in technology benifits us greatly . We can now learn about new exiting things have fun while improving eyesight and we do not have to wait .",10.0,261,4.517456421001621,18.384615384615387,26,0.5448851774530271,6.0,1.5991649269311066,1.3896749186460426,0.06263048016701461,26.0

9367,1076,1,"To the editor of the @ ORGANIZATION2 , I am writing to state my opinion as to whether computers benefit or harm society . I believe that computers are a great tool for several reason . First , computers are a learning resource , and a way people stay updated with the world around them . Also , computers keep us connected with friends and family more easily . Clearly , computers are more helpful to people than they are harmful . Life as we know it today would be greatly altered without the advances in computer technology that have been made over the past few decades . Today if I need to know something , whether it be for @ ORGANIZATION1 or my own reason I can almost instantly look it up and get answers from many different sources . This helps people to be more educated and updated with the world around them . Dr . @ PERSON2 from @ ORGANIZATION1 recently preformed a study on high @ ORGANIZATION1 teenagers and concluded that , "" @ CAPS1 with access to computers scored signficantly better on standard testing due to background information they have accquired while on line "" . Along with the internet , there are programs such as @ ORGANIZATION4 , and @ ORGANIZATION3 , which help people to learn a new language , or write on the computer . Also , computers keep us updated with events that are happening in the world . For example , when the earthquake devestated @ LOCATION1 , I first saw it on the news , but got very few details . I the looked it up on line and imediatly get the death toll , the aid that was being given , and ways I could help donate . Without computers , I would have known none of this . Another reason as to why computers are so helpful to society is that they are tools that help us to keep in touch with others . With things like facebook and @ CAPS2 , I can chat with people , invite friends over , and even plan parties . Without computers , I would need to call each person individualy , but with computers I can write one message and send it to everyone all at once . This gives me more time to do things like play outside and exercize . Also , things like @ CAPS3 and face book help people to stay in touch with old and distant friends . Studies done by @ ORGANIZATION5 show that @ PERCENT1 of people with some type of social networking account have a more active social life than those who do not according to doctor @ PERSON1 this means that these people will have an easier time adapting to different social situations than these who do not . Clearly , this is a great benefit . In conclusion , the computer helps society a great deal more than it hinders it . It easily allows people to stay educated , updated , and connected . It helps people stay aware of the world around them and educated about everything . It makes things that would other wise take lots of time very quick , giving people the chance to do other things such as playing outside . It keeps people socialy capable and active , and allows people to connect with others .

If you want to find out anything , you can find it on the internet . It is an efficient way to study or find information for school . Before the internet and computers , it would take weeks to find enough information for a paper or business work . This was because all information was found in books . Books did not always give you the information you needed whatever was written was all you got . Because of saearch engines and websites , you can type in whatever you want to look up . It is much easier to log onto a computer and type in a question than search an entire book to find an answer . Computers are the best way to research a topic . Computers are also used to socialize . You can chat with almost anyone on the internet . Being social is one of the most important parts of life . It has been proven by science that social people live longer than people who never talk to anyone . The person you are talking to phnes only give you audio and that does not give you the some thing . video chat can allow you to show someone a picture or an expression .

Actually there are many positive effects that computers have on people . Among those effects are ease of communication , ease of gathering information , and ease of find entertainment .

There are so many different means of communication using the computer , which are all free . For example , instant messaging , @ CAPS1 - mail video chat , chat rooms , @ CAPS2 ( and other social networking sites ) , are all there and help you communicate with friends and family . The positive effect that this has on people is that it allows them to stay in touch with people whom they might not otherwise due to financial or convienency issues . Being social is heathy for people and therefore communication is a positive effect of computers . Information is far easier to aquire when a computer is used .

Furthermore much more useful information can be found on the internet as we will , such as : flight times , prices , restaraunts , stocks , weather , news , and basically any fact that you need to know .

In this economy , I know we all could benefit from not having to pay rental fees for movies and big prices for your exams or playstation games . Internet gaming is very amusing and you can find many good games for free . In addition to that , there are websites who offer free movies and television shows to be streamed right to your computer .

9375,331,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , A recent study by scientists shows that too much sitting down , especially in front of computers is dagerous to health . This is only one reason why I think that , although they are useful , computers are not entirely beneficial to our society . The hinder us from excersising , interacting with nature , and spending time with family and friends . Excercising , as we all know , is necessary to remain as a fit and health human being . But how is this possible with some people going to work everyday and getting shut in their offices at their computers all day . Too much computer time even for kids , can lead to obesity and overweightness . Also , like I mentioned before scientists have concluded asked , that too much sitting is bad for you . It is not how the body was built to work . If you have seen wave , one of @ ORGANIZATION1 ' s most recent movies , undertaking is easy . The humans in that movie , after relying on computers for so long , became obese and fat and had no muscle . This is an of course , but minor visions of this are going around the world . Going out do instead of sitting a computer is a sure way to healthy . The next thing that computers restrict us in is our ability to experience nature . Even simulations do not cut it . If you wanted to see a frog or of some other animal , can not just @ ORGANIZATION2 it , look for it in the real . Developing a connection to nature can really nurture the use of that is and I will . Instead of exploring a computer , explore the world as we know it until it is or you are too old . Learn how to do somthing by . Instead of hiring someone to make at , make it yourself . Do it to learn it , sit at a computer website to hire someone ! Get up and get outside ! As you become more dependent on your computer , you become less dependent on family and friends . It causes there to be a lift between family members . Your family might not be able to help you when you are in need . If you are an adult , and you are on the computer all the time for something other than work , then your not supporting your family , you have no income , no life , and no future . Why would anyone do this to themselves ? Imagine this ! : You have nothing except your laptop . you are a , on and have family relations . Nobody wants to be that kind of loser living on the streets ! You have nobody and nothing except for your computer , and you have wasted your life away .

And you think about the millions of people who spend their time chating on the computer . You also wonder about the amount of exercise those people would have , and would they be able to interact with friends and family members . Just think about your current lifestyle is it occupied with computers or is it free and wild ? When you think about chatting to people do you think communicating in person or communicating by aim ? I have surveyed friends and resulted with five out of ten go home and chat to friends online . This upset me because this half mainly had kids that did not play sports but yet they were very talkative , so in aim a problem I still have yet to find out . I asked question like "" what do you do at home ? "" , "" are you a computer geek ? "" . ( @ CAPS2 questions were only used to support my survey ) The next time you are asked to chat online please decline before you to become obsessed with the computer . The amount of exercise a person gets depends on who it is . There are some who live on their computers like the @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 ( a comcast commercial ) and some who do not know what a computer is ( not commenting ) . I am here to teach about the benifits of exercising and not the un natural ways of a computer . Did you know people can loose weight by exercising ? If you just pick up that old curling weight one curl is ten times as better then a click of a computer mouse do not believe me try it . Interacting with people is a big part of our life it is how we get , give orders and it is a lot faster type of communication then sending a email . Without interacting with one another we can suffer from depression . Depression can make people sick for example , my father , when @ CAPS5 was divorsed the depression effected his body and mind . At the age of @ NUM1 @ CAPS5 got a rip in his small intestine that grew infecte and could have ended his life . I believe this was from lacks of communication and this happens everyday to everyone just open your eyes and relise what a computer can do to a man or woman .

As you can see , webcamming is so much easier than spending more time money , and my moms time and getting a ride over her house . Computers make life so much more convienent . Another example how this is so much easier is now computers help you with school work . Have you ever had to write a report ? we will , now many times teachers especially enjoy them typed because many students have messy hand writing and most kids will not like writing it anyways . Like myself , I type faster than I write and that is why I agree @ PERCENT1 that computers benefit society . Most importantly , computers can help you find a good job online and even help type a great resume for you . How impressive would that be ? If I was applying for a professional position of a job , I know I will type my resume .

First off , comptuers are great way to communicate with other people whether it is instant - messageing , email , video - messaging , or services like @ ORGANIZATION1 . @ DATE1 , Computers offer many learning opportunities . There are thousands or websites with information about your search whether it be about simple things like how to bake cookies or even more complex searches like how many stars are in the sky . Last but not least , computers just simply make life easier by helping you with everday needs . To begin , computers are a great source of communication . I remember a time when my father traveled to @ LOCATION1 on business . Because it costs so much money to pay for international cellphone service , my dad could not call using his cell phone . Instead , my father called using @ ORGANIZATION1 . It was great because it was right on the computer . Besides making live communication easier , computers also help to communicate news , weather few weeks ago , the the home was out . It was to shout the @ DATE1 , so my family had no way to . Since are than our cable provider , we were able to look up . School was indeed our computer , we world . Plus , computers offer more learning opportunities . Aside from being a great source of communication , computers are fantastic for searching and research . For almost all of my school assignments that required research , I had used a computer . Sometimes , you can even find articles from library books online . Some people say that the library is always the best place to find information but I disagree . More than half the time , the internet has beyond enough information for what I need . Studies show that @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 people say that computers answered their question better than any library book , did . Also , computers make life a whole lot easier . Computers make life so much easier . From typing to research to communicating and even to making travel arangements , computers help to make everday chores a lot easier . When my cousing was in highschool , she was assigned a @ NUM3 word essay for homework . First off , it is pain having to count everyword and also , most importantly it is no fun having to write that much so my cousin decide to just type it . It saves time and is way neater . She finish her typed essay in @ NUM4 hour while love friend finished in an @ NUM4 @ NUM4 / 2 hours because she hand wrote it . it is you on computers are esier . To conclude , computers are beneficial because they are a great source of communication , they offer many learning opportunities , and they make life so much easier .

Lastly , computers are importat @ CAPS2 people that work with them . there are many reasons why I believe that computers benefit our society . Do you know that computers give people the ability to learn about faw away places . Sometimes people , do not know when they want to leave the country . With a computer you can organize it all . Somoe people like my family , like to go visit their familys in other places , @ CAPS2 example , once my mom told me we were going on a trip to @ LOCATION1 to go visit our family she told me she already got the tickets on the computer . I was very happy when we went and I saw how beautiful @ LOCATION1 is . Some people like to see new and beautiful places . Such as , @ LOCATION3 , @ LOCATION2 and even @ LOCATION4 . Let me tell you about how computers allow people to talk to other people online . Most people have myspace and that allows kids my age to keep in touch . Also , facebook that you can and people that you probly have not seen in a long time . @ CAPS2 exsample , one time I was looking aroung facebook and found my old bestfriend @ PERSON1 . I was so happy cause when she moved I thought i would never talk to her again . I am @ PERCENT1 positive that everyone in this world has a yahoo you could find people really quikck and talk to them . Would you belive that there is so many jobs and responsibilities that require you to have a computer .

I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them , it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things . Therefore , computers have a positive efefct on people . students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students would not be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse . Adults use computers often for work and planning , so if there weren ' t any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money , not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets . Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money . However , with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world . Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok . Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time . Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future , as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather it is for school . college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e will not need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something . Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do . As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work , it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons .

Is this what you want for your you and your children to be separated by tecongly ? Computers are not always safe for teens and children of all ages . There are many reasons why computers can sometimes not be safe for your children or teens . I say this because sometimes we are worried about are kids safty and when your child is on the computer you have no idea who they are talking to or what they are talking about . Teens are most / likely going to met other people online and there are stalkers , posers , and other people out there that are pretending to be soomeone they are not and your child can be one of those peoples who fall for it and it can lead to meeting someone they might not know and they can be kiddnapped , rapped anyting can happen .

You also @ MONTH1 think that they are not getting enough exercise . we will you are right but I am going to explain way your wrong . You can do things like learn , socialize , and actually become healthy . The first thing you could do is learn . While you are on the internet you can go to learning websites . Some of thoes websites can teach you about faraway places like @ LOCATION1 , @ ORGANIZATION1 , @ LOCATION2 and many more . You can also learn about people and their cultures . Take @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 for example , you could learn their culture and the @ CAPS5 they celebrate and why . Another thing you could do is take online classes if you are having trouble in school . Another thing you could do so the computer is socialize . You might think or say that when you are on the computer you can not socialize with family and friends . we will you can . There are websites like @ CAPS6 and facebook where all you do is talk to family and friends . Now you can webcam people . When you webcam you can see the person whom you are talking to you can hear them and they could hear you through a microphone on the webcam . Lastly you could go into chatrooms like @ CAPS7 ( aol instant message ) and talk to people while you are on that sight . The last thing you can do is become more healthy . Is it not surprising ? yes , you can go onto websites that teach you day by day how to eat right and exercise . Websites like @ PERSON1 esang . com car give you a might eating schedual right for your . After that website you could go out and get the you will need . Another thing that the computer offers is hand - eye coordination . While you are looking at the screen your had is controling the "" mouse "" while the , mouse controls where you go on the worldwide web . Lastly you will eventually want to go outside after visiting websites that show you moments and gardens of this world .

They do benifit are society grately . it is a way that family members can keep in touch , it makes your life easier booking a flight and keeping a flight and tastly they help kids with school work . They can bring people together . Firstly , they are a great way to keep in touch . In my own expierence I have a brother at college and when I miss him or need to talk to him I can always send him an email or vidoe chat with him . Do you have someone , you do not get to see everyday ? It can really make your family closer , because you talk more , with your realitives , and with friends . Friends more and go away but you can always chat it you need them . In a time of pain all you want is a friend . When the friends away , a computer probably helped our , too , just getting there . Booking plans without a computer would be a hasal , waitting on the phone for hours , at end , with computers you can do it all in all about five minutes . I have had a expierence when my plane was canceless but did not know until , she went on the computer and checked . So she just switche are flight and we were off but could you imagine going the next day to find out that your flight was canceled and try all day to get on a flight and might not . With computers you can check every hour on the hour if you like . It we will even say if there delayed so you do not wait in the airport for five hours . When it comes to traveling computers are a hesasity . Has that ever happened to you ? Most likly . Yes once you were happy you had a computer . On the other hand , it also helps with your education . When class is over and your teacher is trying to scramble to get the homework out , mostly no ones listioning all they want to do is scat . About nine out or ten kids will not know the assignment when they get home that night . I know that is happened to me . As a eighth grader you probably did the of just forgeting all about and just taking the concerned . You could use your computer . Most schools use some or device , here at @ CAPS2 he have were all are teachers post , grades , test / quizs coming up and homework . it is just one click away from every thing we need . It all right there , together . Most @ CAPS3 kuchers will be a let happier if their kids come , in with there homework then without . would not you be ? From school fund raisers to the lunch menu it is all there . In conclusion , computers do help us from everyday use . to special uses .

9389,507,1,"Dear local newspaper , I strongly think that manypeople are not benefiting fromusing computers . There are so many more things people can do besides go on the computer . By using the computer , people are getting less exercise , not enjoying the nature , and not interacting with family or friends . By using the computer , people are not getting many benefits . As i mentioned , people who use computers too much are getting less exercise . By not exercising , this could really affect people ' s health . From recent studies by @ ORGANIZATION1 , @ PERCENT1 of people whouse computers too much are overweight . That is an extremly high statistic ! By computers affecting this many people ' s lives is ridiculous . This many people really should not be over weight . If these people are not getting exercise they could become addicted to the computer . If peopole are getting addicted to the computer they @ MONTH1 start to do bad things with the computer . They could publish bad things go on ridiculous websites , and watch horrible things . The worst is probably watching bad things . It really puts a bad influence on everyone . Lastly , if you are on the computer too often it could affect your eyes . If you are staring at the computer all day , your eyes @ MONTH1 not be used to seeing everything else . it is hard for your eyes to transfer from seeing one thing to the next . Clearly , being on the computer is bad for health . Not enjoying nature is also something that people are not benefiting from . As you @ MONTH1 know , getting freshair is good for everyone . it is always nice to smell the nice @ DATE1 air after being in school all day . Many people do not do this because as soon as they get home it is to the computer . These people are losi a lot of refreshment . I recently interviewed @ PERSON1 she told me that , "" many people do not get to see what is on in the world because of computers . "" They never take that to look at anything that is going on around them . By keeping updated . You never know what topic @ MONTH1 pop up in school you could always benefit from checking on mother nature . Lastly , there are always animals that need help . Have you ever been in a situation where a stray dog needs a home i have and by helping these animals you are saving life . Many people do not have this opportunity because they are on the computer . Obviously , there are many people missing out on the beauty of nature . My last reason is hat by being on the computer you are not interacting with family or friends . In some cases , the person who is addicted to the computer is the parent . If you are a parent you need to help your family with everyday chores . I know , they can be innoying to have to do but you are helping your family and that is all you can do . Also , if you are a parent that has children they always need help . Some kids are younger and do not know how to find information for a project . But , that is why a parent is there . But , if the parent is on the computer they are not able to fulfill this requirement . I know that my brother is always looking for help because he is younger . Lastly , family parties and computers do not mix . From past experience , when family has come over my brother has sat on the computer without even coming to say "" hello "" to anyone . I find this extremly rude . I just hope that family members do not get offened by this . Clearly , using the computers takes time away from family . In conclusion , people should have limited time on computers . By using computers people do not have enough exercise , are not enjoying nature , and spend less time with family .

9400,1439,1,"Dear local newspaper , I am sure you will agree with me about keeping the computers in this world . I am sure you will agree with me about keeping the computers in this world because computers help everyone in their education . For example when i do not understand some words i go to the computer type www . dictionary . com . Then i words that i do not understand . After that the definition comes up and in a faster time because when i look in the dictonary i take about @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 minutes to just find a word but on the computer it takes me @ NUM3 seconds . Also computers let us chat and send massages when we can not see or take to a person so we send massages and the receive the message them they send back a message . Lastly computers help on english class like on spelling , writing , typing , editing & revising . that is why i think we should keep computers in this world . I know everyone does not know everything . Computers could help us in math , by using formilas and a calculator on calculator . com . Also computers help in science , by going to @ LOCATION1 and asking questions like , "" what is matter or what are . Finally i am gonna talk about not understanding some words . I always go to dictonary . com so that website could give and help understand the word and get the real definition . I always use these @ NUM2 websites when i am stuck in math or science or in english . Those websites could help a lot in our education . that is my way of thinking about the computers helping us in our education . My parents are always staked about me talking to my friends and hanging out with them . So , when i can see or talk to my friends i go myspace or facebook or msn to talk and send messages to my friends . We just keep chating and sending can messages because our parents do not let us hang out . Mostly everyone does the same . I do we could also send much other pictures , music and lot more . that is my opinion of why we should have comuters because we need to chat or send messages . At the end you know we all need to type our essays , lesson and more . The computers help use make power points they check our spelling , the could also change why we wright like cursive and more , they also help in editing & revising .

9401,913,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , I have been informed that recently , people are questioning the use of computers . Some say computers have negative effects on people when using them but I for one disagree with that statement . I believe that computers in today ' s society have created an atmosphere of learning , communication , and an ideal amount of creative fun . Computers are changing the way everyday people live . This technology is the basis of our future , and our future has evolved around our computers . People learn so they can become better at things , be aware of what is going on , and to gain the knowledge that possibly help mem succed in life . Computers gona access to information that people want to know whether it is to learn how it dance using youtube . com , to learn about a possible vacation spot your family might visit , or to research a topic for a school paper : computers have it all . It sits right at home so there is no need to drive to the library and wait for a book with the right researching skills , almost anybody can find the exact information they are looking for . Computers contribute to people who want to learn . Being a popular used computer have beenimportant to make them the best . Whether that means faster internet better , researching book or more websites , a computer has it all . Back before the telephones was invented , people struggled to have a reliable source of communications with where communication is important because it is the main source of communicating . Through the computer , @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 , and emails are easy and guarenteed ways to talk to everybody . With just a simple click of a mouse a person can talk to their bestfriend as if they were right next to them . Communication plays an important role for a civilization or society . It makes life so much easier without creating a place where people become lazy . Talking to people by using the computer has become easier and more dependable than ever . People can email their teachers if they have a question for homework , people can check there grades online , and people can talk to their friends and family all they want whenever they want . So we people say that the computer . If a sibling is away at college , their @ CAPS3 , when a family is to gether , they could since new things are discovered through the computer everyday . can come to a person in multiple ways . A computer can emphazize the fun is never a bad thing . Computers offer video games , learning games , and that bring creativity to . This technology gets people every to have an open mind with everything . It allows them to have fun but at the same time learn something about the world or even themselves . Sometimes computers can inspire people to do something like start a group to make the environment better or go running around ther block . Even though the actual computer is inside the fun and creativity can be whenever a person wants it to be . Computers expand a person ' s knowledge , allow one to communicate , and create a whole new word of fun . Researching topics can be easily accessed through a computer . Communicating with others makes life easier and having fun while inspiring people everywhere makes computers have a total positive effect on people . It creates a new atmosphere of enjoyment of different things . Computers effect people in the greatest way and I do not know why some people doubt it is magnificent ways of indudging people in the environment .",10.0,280,4.916181827094295,17.757575757575758,33,0.4770017035775128,6.0,1.7206132879045997,1.404826957666508,0.015332197614991482,33.0

I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time , but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer . Disadvantages such as cyber bullying , illegal websites , the criminals that use the internet to target days , and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work . I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids . Mostly kids right name from school , drop there backpack , and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework , they sit right down in front of the computer . Then what happens to that homework ? It usually does not get done . That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average . However , homework is not the only school work effected by the computer . Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones . This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them . Not getting work done is not the problem . Computer presents to kids through . It also helps with bullying ; cyber bullying . Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer . Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages . These hurtful messages @ MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings , it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves . Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework were not bad enough . there are also criminals on the computer . These criminals prey on kids . They can find passwords to accounts . They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day . Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there . Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day , there not the only ones . Adults are affected just as much and just as easily . One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the "" great deals "" they can find on the computer . But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites . Websites that are selling stolen merchandise . Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling , they have all of your personal information . From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft . Does that realy sound a "" great deal ?

9408,1522,1,"Dear editor of the @ PERSON1 , I heard you are writing a section in your newspaper about computers and I just thought I would voice my opinion . Personally , I think computers have a positive effect on people . First , I think computers are swell because you are able to learn things about faraway places , like countries on the other side of the world , from the comfort of your home . Also , the information on the internet can help with students ' schoolworks . Finally , you are able to talk with other people on - line . These are just a few points why computers are very importent , that you should include in your article . First off , editor of the @ PERSON1 , I think computers are good for mankind becasue you are able to learn about places on the other side of the world , while sitting at home drinking hot cocoa . This is so very convinient . There are websites containing the geography , languages , and traditions of countries waiting for you to learn . For example , once my friend , @ PERSON3 , was planning on going to @ LOCATION1 for a business trip , but had no idea how to speak the language . I recommended the website , www . Indianow . com and in two weeks she was speaking like an expert . Another time , my sister , @ PERSON4 , was visiting her in - laws for the first time . They were full @ CAPS1 and she wanted to bake something traditional for them . She looked up a recipe on the web and everyone was satisfied with the scrumptious ravioli she made . This is just one reason the internet is so useful . Second , computers are an amazing invention because you can find help for schoolwork easily . My brother , @ PERSON5 , was having problems with learning about the seasons , but with one click , he was full of knowledge . Also , now - a - days they even have on - line tutors and on - line colleges ! Professor @ PERSON2 states that @ PERCENT1 of passing college students are earning their degree online . This is a fabulous point on why computers are so important . Lastly , computers are really significant to society because you are able to talk with other people online . With videochat , chatrooms , facebook and @ CAPS2 , you are bound to make a friend who would last a lifetime . I know I did ! There are even on - line dating sites and matchmakers . For instance , after mu uncle divoriced my aunt , she was devastated and could not date again for the longest time . I told her to try one of those on - line dating sites , she took my advice and found a lovely man . They have been dating for @ NUM1 months . Last @ DATE1 he proposed . They are now happily engaged . This is my last reason how computers can change someone ' s life in a positive way .

The question is , are these advances for the better ? Or will they take a turn for the worst ? Today i will be talking to you about technology , and why i think it is benefitting society poorly . With people spending less time excercising and enjoying nature , leaving ther social life behind by constanly being on the computer , they do not realize how much they are hurting themselves . The number of obese people especially in children , increases each day . This is caused by lack of excersize because some people are too busy responding to texts , talking on the phone and playing unneeded video games . Not only are they physically harming themselves , but they are definitley missing out on the wonderful aspects of mother nature ! Why not get out for a little , escape the technology prison cell you have all been reeled into . The @ ORGANIZATION1 is one of the most beautifuly countries in the world , take advantage that ! Now , without proper excersize , your putting you heart at serious risks . Even doing smaller things , like jumping jacks or cuntups , can help make you and you heart healthy ! Your parents , and even your parents parents , are who brought you into this world , faught for you in times of need , and would do anything to protect you . What would you say if i told you technology was pushing them away ? Texting at the dinner table while they are trying to make conversation , never leaving you room because you playing "" fun "" games , hiding behind he face of technology all the things a vast number of people do instead of socializaing with the people who matter most : family and friends .

But , you can not talk on the phone due to long - distance calls ; so with a computer people do not have to lose touch ! it is quite easy @ CAPS1 people to talk with others from anywhere without having to actually see them . Computers are an easy way to stay in touch with family , too . Therefore , people can talk to their distant relatives from all over when you do not even have to go visit them . Having a computer helps people to keep distant friends and family close in touch . Lets face it , the world is relying more and more on technology and computers . But , if young people start using computers sooner then in life it will make it easier to get a better job . Lots of jobs ask @ CAPS1 technological skills in order to be hired ; so having a computer when younger automatically prepares young adults @ CAPS1 life . Besides that , there is a computer injust about every work place that is up - to - date ; restaurants , hotels , retail stores . and even in construction business . Nevertheless , computer skills are not just a good skill to have ; they are a necessary skill . Last , Computers are a faster and easier way to find new things and learn more about different topics . Instead of looking through various books and encyclopedias @ CAPS1 researching , why not search the topic ? Although , the computer and internet should not completely replace books , it is a valuable researching tool . Someone that has never been to the pyramids could easily just research the pyramids and see amazing pictures , ancient history on them , and learn so much . Computers can help you learn so much about the world without having to leave your house . Now is the time to make your decision on whether or not you think computers are giving a positive effect on people . @ CAPS1 the reasons of keeping intouch , giving .",10.0,201,4.483525234718365,17.5,24,0.4774346793349168,6.0,1.6199524940617578,1.4056390622295662,0.004750593824228029,24.0

Computers are beneficial to society because it is a way to connect with the world , a way to increase responsibility , and helpful for education . Computers are beneficial because they help people connect with the world . You can use a computer to find anything that is on the web , so you can find information about places that interest you or places that you would like to visit . According to the @ ORGANIZATION1 , @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 people check the internet for places to @ ORGANIZATION1 to before they actually go . @ CAPS1 , it is a way to connect with faraway friends .

The computer is @ CAPS1 one of the fastest ways you can learn about current events . All you have to do is go to a news website . All of these connections will widen people ' s views of the world . Computers are a way to increase responsibility , too . When the people use the computer , there are many choices that they have to make , like what websites to go to and what to download or watch . Having these individual chances will help people think of what the right choice is . Even if you choose the wrong choice , you will learn from your mistake . Second , the computer is a very fragile machine and it takes a lot of to handle . For example , you can not have any liquid nearby and must not throw objects near or on the computer . Thinking of this and making sure not to damage the computer are ways to increase responsibility . Lastly , computers are beneficial because they help education . Teachers can use the computer to make lessons more interesting . For example , they can create points and presentation to providea @ CAPS1 , students can on what they learned at school . @ CAPS1 , you can make for the students , which provide them with their homework and information about the classes one of my friends once said "" @ CAPS2 the I would definitely be failing "" . Nobody wants to talk and a great way to present this . Lastly , if you want information on a particular school , you can just search it online and find it is website . School websites have information about classes , events , and clubs . They provide the information that you need to think about going to that school in an easy , convenient way , while finding the website for the school take no more than @ NUM2 minutes , actually going to that school for information can take more than just @ NUM2 minutes , and even hours .

Also online catalouges or advertisments help the economy of stores worldwide . @ CAPS2 people were not allowed to use computers most of the modern would not exist . @ PERSON1 said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write , talk , or write back for much cheaper !

9416,1114,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 , I am here to prosoade you to agree with me on , that the use of computers does benift society . Some reasons why I think this are school work and business stuff . Also the over all reasearch on important things . My first reason why I think that computer use is benifiting society is because @ CAPS6 is oftenly used for school work . In example use @ CAPS6 for projects . Also some type of reasearch they might be interested in . But one of the most important reasons why computers use is so high is because , there are a lot of people taking online classes . Wheather it is for college or for the sake of your own learning . This is why I think school work shoud be a valid reason for benifiting society . My second reason why I think @ CAPS6 benifits our society is the business or job part of the computer . Many people , @ CAPS7 a days work at home , they have their own office . They all most create their own company . Another reason is many people also use "" @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 "" or publisher . @ PERCENT1 of the people who work at public businesses do this , going along with ads , when could also or another reason for this . But then again , you could @ CAPS7 pay your bills on line ! I remember when I helped my mother pay on of the bills online , and let me tell you , "" @ CAPS6 was easy ! "" . My mother said she do @ CAPS6 more often @ CAPS7 that she knows how to use @ CAPS6 ! "" @ CAPS7 the business side should be more then enough , for me to convince you . My last reason is over all reasearch on all important things . Some of these important things are : online catalogs , the news and another one the most important things of all job openings . I know my self , and I love to shop ! So instead of leaving the house , I just go on the online catalog to my favorite store called "" @ CAPS8 "" . The main reasons why I go online is b / c they have more variety and sizes . @ CAPS7 for the news , that is all for my parents b / c i do not watch the news . Lastly , job openings @ CAPS7 that I am @ NUM1 , I would like to find a job , even if it is mimumum wage . @ CAPS6 ' s still something , right ? This should be a high priced reason for agreement ! In @ CAPS9 , I think my @ NUM2 reason are very we will clear ; school work , business , and over all reasearch .

What if you were bored to death , and you could not watch t . v . or play games ? Some experts are about people because they think they are spending too much time using their computers and not enough time exercising , enjoying nature , and interacting with family and friends . On your computer : you can watch videos and play games , you can chat and talk to people , and you can even boost up your grade . I honestly think that the thought of people being on their computers too much is a silly thought @ CAPS2 , let ' s look at how a computer can change your life . Lets say you have a history report the tomorrow , you forgot your history book at school , and you know nothing about the report . You are going to fail if you do not hand it in , so why not turn on your computer and open up the internet browser . I remember @ TIME1 year I was doing a report about the @ CAPS4 @ CAPS3 . I literally knew nothing about them and I failed to bring home my book . I opened up the internet and typed in @ CAPS4 @ CAPS3 in @ ORGANIZATION1 and @ DATE1 I found out that I got a @ NUM1 on the report . You can also use the computer just to look up information for for about something that you might learn in school . "" @ TIME1 @ DATE1 , I was reading about the @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 and a few days @ DATE1 we talked about how that @ CAPS7 posibly could have been made . I was the only student in our grade that knew that answer . You can use the computer for playing games that are related to school . For example , how fast can you complete all of these multiplication problems or division problems . Look at what computers can do . If you got bad grades ( without computer ) , you will go to a bad college and have a bad job , however , if you got good grades ( with computer ) , you will go to a good college and get a good job . Next , let ' s look at how you can chat or talk to people . You can have a mesaging connection with someone by using @ CAPS8 or a free to free conversation using @ ORGANIZATION2 on your computer . Studies show that @ PERCENT1 of people with computers have either @ CAPS8 or @ ORGANIZATION2 installed in their computers . You can also communicate with people who has an email address . I remember having a problem with my laptop and my crush knows everything about them . So I emailed him and how I get a response and I fixed my laptop . You are able to interact with people by meeting them online and then them on public . Everyone know about those dating websites that matches two people and them together . A computer can really the of your life . Lastly , let ' s look at what you can do in the computer when you are bored . Why you go youtube and watch videos that look appropriate and interesting ? "" @ CAPS10 , I was done with homework and I did not know what to do , so i online and spend only watching youtube videos , sometimes people like playing games . Just @ TIME1 , I was playing tetris , but only for @ NUM2 minutes because I needed a goodnight ' s before the @ CAPS11 . You can also listen to the radio on a website . Statistics show that @ PERCENT2 of people that listened to the radio @ CAPS10 were in cars . But @ PERCENT3 is also @ PERCENT4 more listening to the radio online . Not only can a computer increase your grades and improve your life , can entertain you as we will . As you can see , saving the of computers is is a silly idea and is absolutely non - sense .

Heres the controversy , many experts believe computers do not benefit society but people , such as myself , believe the exact oppositte . Their are many benefits to oconing a computer such as they are always a source of information , allow you to talk online with others , and they can help people with their school and job loans . No matter what the problem , do not you believe a computer is always a source of information that could help ? A computer has endless information on any topic unlike books . This is because everyone , from the most to the least intelligent people , have their opinions , ideas , and hard facts in a computer on the web . I once watched a movie of a man who despised computers and new technology . Thus , for most of his life he wondered the world with no hint or clue as where to @ CAPS4 in search of a rare artifact called the @ CAPS1 diamon . He never found the diamond but his son who searched it on the internet found out the root geo from @ CAPS1 meant underground in ancient @ CAPS2 culture . due to a computer he found the diamond underground , beneath the ancient @ CAPS2 temples . Therefore , I believe if people would embrace technology such as computers they would find many things that they never thought of . also , computers give you the ability to chat online with family and friends . Many people use computers to stay in touch when they have no available phones , with a computer you could chat with your friend down the street or your family member on vacation in another country . No matter where you are a compute can always be on available form of communication . for example , the only way many of our soldiers fighting wars stay in touch with their loved ones back home is by talking to them online with a computer . One thing I know is no matter how old to probably about @ NUM1 , if you have a job or go to school you have used a computer to help you with @ CAPS4 . Whether it was getting an answer to a homework question or researching a person for a project , we all use computers . Computers even have the ability to help you make brochures or pamphlets . This can greatly help you advertise if that is something you do at work . Also , many people do not have the neatest handwriting so they type their essay or letter to their boss , you can even choose what type of handwriting it types . No matter the case , with work a computer always helps . Yes , I do believe computers benefit the society . Althourgh , some experts do disagree with me and believe they can become an addition .

9421,900,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , I am aware that some people think computers have a negative affect on others , but I think it is the opposite . Computers have completely changed the world . People can save work on them , visually experience things they have never seen before , or even catch up with old buddies . In my opinion computers have a positive affect on people . With computers you can create documents , pictures , and even movies that will stay on your computer forever . How about your newspaper company ? Does somebody hand write every paper that comes out ? Without computers hundreds of copies of your newspaper would not be able to b made every day . Not to mention , what would happen if you did not use computers and a fire occured ? All of your hard work will be turned into ash , but if it was on the computer you be able to retrieve it . You can save anything on a computer . Another reason why computers have a positive affect on people is because throught the internet you can visually experience places or things you could not before . If I was going to book a vacation I would not just trust a book , I would will not to go on the computer so I could see pictures , videos , or hundreds of other articles I could not see anywhere else . This goes for anything else like furniture , instruments or even cloths . Computers offer alternative views that books do not . Not only can computers save data and give you visuals , but they give you an oportunity to catch up with old friends , relatives , or even meet new people ! Instead of endlessly searching through phone books you can just type in their name and you bound to find somewhere on the internet . Popular websites like @ CAPS1 make this extremely easy . When my dad was in search of his childhood friend he typed his name on @ CAPS1 and ended up calling him @ NUM1 minutes later ! That would not have been possible without computers . Computers truley do have a positive affect on people everywhere without them many things today would not be possible .

9422,500,1,"Dear local news paper , I agree that technology has a positive effect on people . Just like other electronic devices , computers can help you with hand eye coordination . Plus , some people like teachers , want to get staff off the internate for their students to learn about people and places . Others just want to talk to other family or friend member in other towns , states , countries , or continents . Once you read this letter , then you will understand my reasoning . Firstly , these technology enhanced dictionaries help you with hand - eye coordination . Before the computer , people had lose success in writing quickly . They had to make short notes or short handed notation like w / or . Nowadays people write quicker and can write full words and sentences . They never understood what they wrote they put it in full sentences . When you play computer games , it gives you even more hand - eye coordination , That was only the first three reasons . Secondly , teachers use computers to get alot of school work and get information about history and geography . like an online school book , it can get information on just about anything . It can look up when @ PERSON1 was born . When the dinosaurs went extinct . Fun what the government is doing now . A computer can store what you learn too . It also has search engines that help you locate the information like @ ORGANIZATION1 or @ ORGANIZATION2 . Statistics show that more than @ PERCENT1 of people on earth use search engine to find something on the computer . On search engines they have websites , pictures , movies , maps and more . That is why people use computer for research . Have you ever fell like you do not want to travel across the @ LOCATION2 just to see your relative . we will I have a solution to your problem . Computers have all sorts of stuff to can fanicate to other people . The computer mostly uses e - mail . E - mail is like a letter , but put electronically . It also has @ CAPS1 . It is also like a letter . If you buy a special camera that connects to your computer you can talk to them personaly . You do not even have to travel to see your relatives in @ LOCATION1 . That is the last reason why computers have positive effects on people . Most people use computers effectively . They get hand eye coordination . Also , the learn important facts about places and people . Plus they can talk to other people .

9423,296,1,"Dear local newspaper , my name is @ PERSON1 , & I think that computers are very usefull and that people learn a lot from them . The computer is very smart and is probably the best technology invented . Computers help when you need to know something about a certian person . @ CAPS3 example is it helps students with homework . Last reason of why I think computers are useful is that they help you get a hold of family and friends . First example of why I think computers are usefull is they help you if you need facts about a person . One example is you want to go to your a policeman and your leader tells you to meet him at @ ORGANIZATION1 , so you go there and he tells you the person they are going after but you do not know anything about him and you need a computer to see what he is convicted for and see his criminal record . @ CAPS3 example is if your teacher wants you to do a report about "" @ PERSON3 lopez , "" but you do not know anything about him so you would use the computer and read about his life . Last example is if you want to learn about your countries history and the leaders behind it then you would use the computer . Second example is students and their homework . One example is when your teacher says "" I want a essay on @ PERSON2 and I want it to be neat . "" But you have very handwriting and you can not do it on paper you will have to use word or a writing program on @ CAPS3 computer . @ CAPS3 example is if you forgot to write down your homework in your agenda or something then you can go on the school website and see what your homework is . Last example is if your teacher says find the book about the @ CAPS1 and you go to the library but everyone is taken but you have one by tomorrow . So you can go on the computer and find a place that is closest to you that has the book . Last reason of why I think computers are helpfull in this society is because they help you get a hold of your friends & family . One example is if it takes to long to write letters to each other so you run use online messengers for example like "" @ CAPS2 "" or even "" facebook and myspace . "" @ CAPS3 example is if you do not send the letter to the write addrees so what you do is go online and ask a friend or family member . Last example is if want to see the person and talk to them so you can go webcam with them and even talk . I hope you agree with my opinion and think computers are usefull an also good for people .

9424,129,1,"Hi ! My name is @ PERSON1 and I think computers are not bad . I think this because yes , people do play the computer to much , but they can also learn a lot of things . Another reason is that some kids like bullys can stop bulling and spend time on the computer to stay away from stress . You can also talk to your friends and even video chat with them too . Computers can teach you a lot . For example @ CAPS1 your computer breaks or has virus you can just figure out the problem by yourself . You can also learn or read the news that your missing . For example you can also ask questions that you do not understand and people would answer your question . In moder afoot kids , teens , and even adult computers to look up things that they do not understand . For example , when I read along a book and read a word that I do not know and read around @ CAPS1 I still do not now I would go to @ LOCATION1 and find what the words mean . Bullys and other people like street people that have computers should stay on the computer and you can just play games . They can play hitting games , shooting games , and even board games . You can even watch fights @ CAPS1 you want . What ever you want you got it . This is a good thing because then no one will get and everyone will be happy . Bullys can also go on the computer to relax and stay away from people that they hate . The computers can make you relax because you do not have to be around people and you can just tell the computer to do what ever you want . Kids , teens , and adult do not have to leave the house justto talk to a friend or two . I said this because most computers hace a microcam and you can comminicate with others . For example my dad is trying to get a computer with a micro - cam so that he can be incontact with my mom , my brother , my sister , and I . He has to get one because the does not live with us any more . He had to leave and go back to @ LOCATION2 . Another example , would be that @ CAPS1 one of your friends move far , far away you can just talk to them on the micro - cam or even send message back and forth .

9428,711,1,"Dear editor , Have you ever stopped and asked yourself which was more important ? Of course I can be talking about anything , but what about computers verses family , friends , nature , your own health etc . we will , I ask myself that quite often , and I feel that it is so much more worth it to be with family and friends than to be infront of a computer . There is so much more that I can tell you , and just after my very first reason how could there even be another side to it ? Why is it that now these days kids can not simply run out to the bus stop without feeling totally winded ? I feel it is because they are not getting enough we will needed exercise ! For example , instead of sitting infront of the computer , kids , and even adults can enjoy going to the gym . Also , children can get more involved with school sports so they can not only be participating in sports , but they can be involed with school too ! Lastly , just by going for a short walk with your dog , your not only walking and getting we will needed exercise , your bonding with your loyal friend . Have you ever been gazing out the car window when you just found yourself being sucked into all the beauty that nature has to offer ? we will , if you have I guess you could never have too much , but if you have not , it is probably because your spending way too much time on the computer ! There are so many different ways that people could learn to appreshiate nature more , such as sitting on a park bench in the @ TIME1 , while absorbing the fresh air and sunlight . Or you could go for a slow , realaxing bike ride through a trail with a constant cool breeze , brushing your face with every of your wheels . Finally , you could pick a warm day to sit out on the beach , and listen to some music , next to the salty ocean . How could you resist those temptations ? Lastly , I believe that family is the most important thing to missing out on ! Without family and friends you miss out on so many good ethics and experiences . You lose out on having good lifetime realationships , and how could you turn dow the offer to be with the people you love ? In conclusion , I feel that computer are taking away most of the things that no one deserves to live without . I mean , how could anyone live without family , friends , the beauty of nature , and your own health ? That is why everyone should make the right desition to take reasponcible charge of their life , and the same question , which is more important ?",10.0,231,4.318915485185184,21.428571428571427,21,0.5121951219512195,5.0,1.5432372505543237,0.9637459942073318,0.008869179600886918,21.0

Without computers , society would not run as smoothly as it does now . One way that computers benefits our society , is that they complete tasks such as writing a paper , researching information , etc , much quicker .

These online social networks connect you and the people in your life to a crazy online adventure . All these websites provide the information that people want and keep nthem logging back on everyday . I think these websites are great and can only improve society . This is my first benefit of a computer . Another way aspect that the computer provides is world news and big events and drama that is happening in our society .

9432,635,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 of late there has been controversy of how Computers affect people ' s lives . I believe that the effects on people negative . My main reasons of this argument are . The persons health their the users we will being . Did you know that over @ PERCENT1 of kids and teens are obese @ NUM1 computers can contribute to this statistic . If a person is eating unhealthy but sizing . They can still be fit but if they go on the computer instead of working off all the . They become fat . This can be a serious problem . Becoming overweight has many health risks liked heart other . It also could prevent a person from excersicing . If they are overweight their legs could ache and a simple set of stairs could become a huge challenge . Do you want in obesity rates ? I would think not . If you watch tv you could picture perfect families . We all know that no family is like that . Introducing computers could mess up that fact even more . For example , my cousin used to be an outgoing friend person . Now because of computers he is a @ LOCATION1 who does nothing else but play on the computer . He gets up eats breakfast . ( The of about ) , then plays on the computer untill lunch . He eats a small lunch and right back to playing . After along @ NUM2 to @ NUM3 more how is of playing . He off the computer , hopps into goes on his laptop all night . This greatly affects his family . They try to get him off but all he does is online . He can not interact with his family and this has a huge infact on it . Even though he could get off and talk one of the only ways of talking to him are through facebook . Now because of this family is . We can easily avoid this by telling every body these known facts . My final argument for you is the users we will being teen many of us have a facebook of @ CAPS3 I have homework I to use the internet for facts and stories . @ CAPS3 I do so to go on facebook . If anyone dows the effect our grades . If we chat on facebook we doing our . If are not doing our homework we will not get a good grade . If we could less to other serious problems . Another thing is that you could actually need your computer to stay . It could be addicting and you might rely on it "" once a to kill himself because he dident have his computer "" .

Computers these days are very advanced and allow you to talk to your friends , allow you to acess information more efficiently , and have increased our man power in scientific research . Almost every teen has a screen name that allows you to chat online with your friends . This function keeps kids in touch and active . Eventhough instant messaging can distract kids from their daily life it can also be amazingly helpful . Just last week a friend of mine had forgotten to write down their homework and easly contacted online . I was able to let them know @ NUM1 a matter of seconds .

9436,203,1,"Dear Newspaper , I think people need computers . It helps them see the world if they can not . It can be used to send important messages to people that are farther away from you . Also if someone has a parent or loved one far away they can see each other through the computer . So here is examples of these three things . Some people can not physically or mentally and can not afford to travel . it is sad how some people are so sick with a disease or illness that they can not go places . But if they go on the internet they can look up pictures and information of places they have never been to which can help them see the world better . But there are people who can help them see the world better . But there are people who have fears which prevent them from travelling to different places . So thet could go to the internet and find ways to help them get over their fears . Which in turn will allow them to get over their fears and let them travel to places . Then there are people who can not afford it . So the internet can help find a good job that pays good money which they can use to afford to travel the world and see it for what it is . What if you need to send a really important message to someone to prevent them doing something or help them live or even stop a war . So take into reconsideration if there is a war going on for a miss understanding . So if the government figures out what happened and they know how to straightin out the situation then they could send a message to the attackers . What happened and that it was not what they thought we did then they would stop fighting and the war would be over . What if a bomb is in the white house you would want to get out of the building or find it and disarm it . So then a guy finds out about it and send a message to the white house and that would save all the people in the white houses lives . Sometimes loved ones go away to some where far away and you can not talk or see them . Someones in the military and he / she has a kid so the computer allows them to see and talk to them through a webcam which would keep the child and parent together and not seperate them . Also you see a friend in facebook who you have not seen in years so you friend him and you guys get back in touch with each other and you can be friends with them again . So in conclusion the computer can do many helpful things . It can fix relationships , save lives , help you get over fears and see the world .

9446,573,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 of the @ ORGANIZATION1 , @ CAPS2 has been a debate on whether modern computer activities are good for people or bad for the people . Some people think that it benefits society because computers can teach hand eye coordination , they can help people learn about faraway places , and allow people to interact with friends . Al of this seems to prove that computers are good for society , but truely it is not . People who use their computers too much can have some harmed side effects , including obesity , red eyes , and even can get cyber bullied . People are using computers to an extent to which it is bad for their health . The number one problem of the @ LOCATION1 is obesity . It seems that people are getting fatter every day . Computers are definetly taking part in the problem . People are spending too much time on their computers and are spending less time exercising , enjoying nature , and interacting with family and friends . These people are spending hours and hours in front of a computer getting heavier every day . They start to eat their feelings because of how lonely they are . This process continues until the certain person can barely yet out of their chair . Obesity is not the only problem that is damaging their health , their eyes are being damaged also . It is obvious that more & more people are having problems with @ CAPS2 eyes everyday . Computers are making this happen . When a certain person is on the computer for only an hour , they are damaging their eyes tremendously . The computer screen is straining their eyes horribly & for the people who are on the computer @ NUM1 - @ DATE1 hours a day are pretty much sending their eyes to blindness . When I go onto the computer for only @ NUM2 minutes my eyes start to water . It is a devastating outcome of using a computer too much . Computers are damaging peoples health & @ CAPS2 should be something done about it . Although computers are not only damaging people health they are also ruining peoples lives . Bullying has been a major problem in the @ LOCATION1 for many years . Kids would be bullyed all day in school and always had a horrible time . But when they got to go home they could be comforted by their family and friends . Computers have recently included a system where you can video chat with friends or @ ORGANIZATION2 . This can be a wonderful thing unless used in the wrong way . As I pointed out before kids are bullied a by in school but when they got home they were able to leave that horrid life behind and be a normal kid . Not any more . This new @ ORGANIZATION2 , video chat , @ CAPS4 , etc . has brought the unlucky bullied students a one way ticket to getting cyber bullied . I have heard of a case where a student was cyber bullied to such an extent that she suicided on the internet to show how depressed she was . Computers made that event possible . Video chat , @ CAPS3 , @ CAPS4 , etc . gives bullies a chance to make their prey depressed into a point where they consider suicide . I can understand why you would contradict my argument but I truely hope that you will be able to understand why this is so important . Obesity , straining the eyes , & cyber bullying should be in my mind enough evidence that computers are bad to get you to write an article about these horrid machines . They are causing a variety of problems in peoples health , mind , etc . I really hope you will consider writing this article .",10.0,260,5.083653973949716,15.421052631578947,38,0.44293015332197616,6.0,1.6490630323679727,1.4329831210560047,0.02214650766609881,38.0
9447,892,1,"Dear Newspaper , I often think about the effect of technology on humans . The human race has discovered many things but our biggest advance is technology . New machines are robots are built all the time , and our knowledge of machines and artificial minds is rapidly growing . The most widely used machine is the computer . People use it for all sorts of things , communucation , awareness and learning and entertainment . Some experts are concerned that people spend too much time on computers and it could not agree more . Computers maybe useful but they are over used . People spend more time staring at the screen than exercising and interacting with friends and family . Computers are also not always dependable or safe . First of all , the biggest computer users are adolesents . Young adults spend hours on websites like @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 , and @ CAPS3 communicating with their friends . At their young age , exercise is very important . Obesity in children from lack of exercise is becoming very common , and it is because young people are glued to their computer screens . The averange child need @ NUM1 minutes of exercise a day , and many have very little none . I say the computers are ok , but only in small doses . The growing mind and body needs to move and exercise . If internet use among children and teenagers is not cut back , some worry that there will be a lot more health problems in the future . Although it is very east to quickly communicat through the internet , it can sometimes do more harm than good . Kids who spend hours @ CAPS4 or emailing their peers spend less time with their families . I had heard parents say they barely see their kids because their always either doing homework . Also , @ CAPS5 to @ CAPS5 conversations are fading . Because of the internet , people no longer need to get together and talk , @ CAPS6 turn on their computers , which is a waste of energy . Why not just go see your friend @ CAPS6 of typing all day ? Lastly , computers have just as many disadvantages as they do advantages . There are plenty of dangers out there in @ LOCATION1 . Online predators lurk as many comers , and your personal information and identity can easily be stolen . The risk of any of these things happening is very high . it is better safe than sorry . So , if you think about it , we really do not need computers to survive . You need your exercise , do not blow it off for online chat . Also , it is very important to interact and be part of your family , and less internet use will cut down the risk of identity theft , or any other problem or virus . it is your time now . Get outside have @ CAPS5 to @ CAPS5 conversation with a friend and internet with your family . You can be healthy , happy , and safe without constantly typing any at the keyboard .",10.0,247,4.97080331568838,13.823529411764708,34,0.524416135881104,6.0,1.6921443736730362,1.3891825234105246,0.025477707006369428,34.0
9448,1028,1,"Dear Newspaper , @ CAPS1 you know that two out of three @ CAPS2 own a computer ? Computers are a very helpful tool that benefit everyone in society . They allow people to communicate with eachother , learn , and teach hand - eye coordination and other good things for school . Computers are a very useful and beneficial part of society . The advance in technology has upgraded computers , and now allows people to communicate through them . For example , new webcams allow people to actually see and talk to each other from you computer screen . This allows people no matter how far to talk to each other and stay in touch . With my webcam I am able to keep in touch with my cousins in @ LOCATION1 . Another way of communication is through email . Through the internet , people can type messages back and forth . It is very fast and easy allowing people to talk to each other more and communicate . As we will as webcams and email computers grants people access to communication websites such as @ CAPS3 ( instant messaging ) or @ CAPS4 . These websites people message each other back and forth very quickly and easily . It is not difficult to do , like writing a letter would be , so people can communicate more efficiently and easily . Computers are very helpful for communication along with @ CAPS6 . Computers are an advancement that could help people learn more about anything . For instace , they could learn about foreigh plaus . All they would have to do is go to the internet , type what they were @ CAPS5 for , and it would come up on the screen . It would allow people to learn about places all over the world . Also , people can see pictures on the computer . For example , if someone wanted to go on vacation faraway , they could type in the place and see what it looks like . However , the computer does not just show places . People could also see animals , other people , the environments , and anything else they want to learn about . Plus , with new websites being created , people could actually see what the earth looks like from space . They can look at houses , the wonders of the world , and much more computers give people the opportunity to learn about so much more . @ CAPS6 more would help people , especially students to have a better education . If you ask anyone in school , they will tell you that computers are a very useful tool . Firstly it allows them to type . Students can type a project or paper on the computer faster and easier . It will also look neater and more orginized . Plus , computers teach students hand - eye coordination . By typing or even just clicking the mouse , students are bettering their coordination . This is due to the fast while they are @ CAPS5 at the screen and typing or clicking , they have a sense of direction and know what to hit or where to put their hands without even @ CAPS5 . Lastly , computers help students because if they need help , they can just ask one of their friends through the computer . Students would better understand the content they are @ CAPS6 and when they go to school , they would already know it . Therefore , computers would lead to students getting better grades . Computers play a big role in society today . They are a way of communication , @ CAPS6 , and allows students to do better in school .

Computers are not a bad thing , but it is is when they are over used they become hurtful to kids health .

The additon of online chat to computers has not only increased computer usage but doubled it . The invention of @ CAPS2 , and instant messaging was never meant to be a bad thing , but it sure did turn into one .

9460,1302,1,"Dear Newspaper , I believe that computers have both possitive and @ CAPS12 effects on people . However , I believe that there are more positive effects than @ CAPS12 . Some of these positive effects would be that they are essential for education , a very usful place to communicate , and they can be fun . My first reason for supporting computers would be that they are very eduactional . For example , you can research almost anything . If you are doing your homework and you forgot an answer . An other reason why @ CAPS1 is educational is because you can type your paper on @ CAPS1 so your teacher can actually read your handwriting . If @ CAPS1 is messy . On the subject , you can work from home if you are sick or on vacation . But how do you get @ CAPS1 to your boss ? Email of course ! wich brings me to my next subject ; @ CAPS2 . Another resoursful thing about computers is @ CAPS2 . There are so many different ways to communicate ; @ CAPS1 ' s unbeleivable . Take I @ CAPS4 for an example . You can @ CAPS5 to peoples cellphones . You can @ CAPS5 to other people that are @ CAPS7 or you can just @ CAPS5 on some websites such as @ CAPS9 , @ CAPS10 , and tons more . You can also vidio chat with people on things like and @ ORGANIZATION1 . Those are just a few ways of communicating on the computer . Finally , I would like to tell you about the fun things you can do on computers . First , you can buy games from a store and download them onto your computer . Personally , The sim are my favorite . I understand that computer games can be a negitive thing because they are addictiing , but if you do not go on for hours and hours , then I do not see what the problem is . Also , they have educational games so learning can be both fun and educational . Another thing you could do is play free games or download the game from the internet do your computer so they are both fast and easy . To @ CAPS11 , Computers can be both @ CAPS12 and positive but I chose to look at things through a positive eye and I think you should too . After all , computers can be educational , a social networks and fun . Son @ CAPS13 my positive eye . You will not be sorry .",10.0,181,4.616932713803458,12.965517241379311,29,0.480106100795756,5.0,1.63395225464191,1.5188509161953387,0.050397877984084884,29.0

9463,720,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , I am writing to you about the use of computers and how they are bad for society . With people getting less exercise , not enjoying nature , and having less interactions they are doing the world more bad than good . Almost everyone has a computer and it gets used more and more and it is just taking away a great time to go be active outside . First , exercise is a very important part of the day and it is happening less and less because kids are sitting infront of there computers all day long . There is so much talk these days how we are the fatest country . we will here is one of the main causes we have almost everyone stairing blankly into a computer screen instead of being active . Computers are a big problem and they cause laziness to occure more often than not because now if you miss your favorite @ CAPS1 . V . show just look online you will find it . Or if you are doing a project just look online and you will find more than enough information and it is just a click away . Second , enjoying nature is a scarse thing now . All you have to do is search online and you could find a picture of your front yard . there are much less people outside . Because who needs to go outside when you could be chatting with a friend or just being on @ ORGANIZATION1 looking up new technology . People who are always on the computer don ' @ CAPS1 care about the enviorment as much because they are wasting electricity and they are more fun to internet on their place that they on . There are a lot less people going places now because who needs to go to @ LOCATION1 when you can just look up pictures of @ LOCATION1 . it is taking away thrills poeple used to have of going places getting out of the house seeing parts of the world far away first hand instead of through computer . Third , there are for less interactions personaly between we will everyone . Kids that text , @ CAPS2 , or facebook chat more then talk in person with friends are loosing talking skills of actually having a conversation . Because online you have time to think then when you talk in person you have nothing to say because you can ' @ CAPS1 think and your not to your full talking potential . People are seeing eachother less and less now that they can text and talk over the computer they think now have no need to see eachother now and it is ok just to talk through the internet . Friends & family start to know who you are less because you can ' @ CAPS1 see emotion through a computer . Also , they say that you can learn more about someone in @ NUM1 minutes of playing with them then in @ NUM1 minutes of talking with them . With that being the case friends make friends now without even knowing that person with full understanding . Lastly , computers are doing more then good to everyone and they are becoming more and more unhealthy . With people getting less exercise , not enjoying nature as much and having less interactions people are just wasting their time infront of a computer screen getting fat rather then going outside with people and just passing a baseball . There are so many better ways people could spend their time than infront of a computer . Why don ' @ CAPS1 they see that ?",10.0,222,4.632634963915491,20.357142857142858,28,0.38879159369527133,6.0,1.5849387040280212,1.2647317292036502,0.01926444833625219,28.0
9464,1063,1,"Computers can be very useful to people . They can help contact friends and family from all over the world . You might need it for typing a paper for school or work , and you can use the internet . If you had a friend or family member move away , computers are an easy way to contact them . Phones do not always give you that option to call from around the world . Say your bestfriend moved out of the country you could email them or instant message them through computers . What if you want to chat with someone right next door even if theres a blizzard and the snow is four feet , computers are a simple way to contact them . When my friend went to @ LOCATION1 for the @ DATE1 I used instant messaging to talk to her . Imagine your at work or school and you were asked to write a five page essay . Do you really want to write it all ? Imagine you , writing out hundreds of those newspaper everyday . Typing is an easy solution that does not require as much work and it takes less time . Typing also makes work a lot neater and easier to read . Not even a library has all the information you need . What if you need to write an article for your newspaper about a newly discovered animal ? A library will not immediately buy new books about it . The internet is an ideal way to get information the moment it happens . What if a celebrity got hit by a bus or a rocket in space just landed sucesfully ? You can not expect to go to the other side of the country to watch and take notes . The internet gives information on anything possible . The internet also allowes students to take online schools or classes . When my oldest brother could not take @ CAPS1 in high school when it was needed for college , he took an online @ CAPS1 class at home . The internet also helps you find vacation spots when your going away from home what if you need a plane , train , boat ticket ? What if you need to rent a car but you can not go over to the store or airport . You can go online to purchase tickets . Have you ever heard someone say "" @ CAPS3 it upon google "" when they do not know the answer to something ? I remember my friend telling me about her new dog , I never even heard of . When I got home I went on the internet and researched it . The internet is a very useful tool to everyone . Going on a computer allows you to talk to anyone , anywhere , type anything needed , or to use the internet .

Sometimes mine is ridiculous ! But when i get on a computer it gets to be much better . Experts say that @ PERCENT1 more people with hand - eye coordination have improved by working with computer . A teacher at @ ORGANIZATION1 said , "" @ CAPS1 students have been working on the computers for about two months now and I have seen an incredible improvement in their hand - eye coordination already .

In conclusion , using computers has started a growing epidemin in the @ LOCATION1 . The most important reasons as to why computers have anegative effect on humans are it limits the amount of exercise , and it almost destroys the physical interactions between humans .

And people sit on the computer all day and do not exercise at all . These are all bad affects computers have , but their not all bad , without them life might be a little harder . Playing computer games , and online poker sounds fun right ? Wrong ! People get addicted to them everyday . Online poker could be dangerous . I remember seeing a show about this guy who was addicted to it . he would put his credit card information in and sit and play all day . Before he knew it , he was in debt . Once he was addicted it was very hard for him to stop . it is a stupid thing to get into because there is no point to it . You sit and waste money , especially with our economy the way it is . A recent study shows that @ PERCENT1 of people who play online poker are addicted within two weeks . Other games are also addicting too . There ' s a website that called addicting . I guess people do not know the affects of being addicted to a computer has on them and their family . Did you know that @ PERCENT2 of electricity in @ LOCATION1 goes to computer ? that is almost half of it going to one thing . I do not think it is right that pretty much everything is done on the computer now . In our economic chrisis I do not think enery should be wasted playing computer games .

The number of computers sold has gone up @ PERCENT3 since @ DATE1 . I understand emailing , and facebook . But do not get out of hand with it . is not being outside on a beautiful day great ? would not you rather enjoy that or excercise rather than sitting glued to a computer ?

I remember when I was younger , everytime I went to my friends house , his dad would be sitting and playing poker and games on the computer . He was very out of shape and lazy . His parents later got a divorce because he turned into a totally different person . Most @ CAPS1 are lazy . We do not like to do work if we do not have to .

I was reading your paper and I notice you had an article on how people are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time going outside , getting exercise , enjoying nature , and that it does not benifit society . i completly disagree with these comments . let me explain . Having computers definatly benifits for all students . Sometimes kids forget their text books at school . But if they have a computer , they can just google the information . That way they get there homework done , and do not have to take a zero . Another thing is , I am sure you have heard of a website called , study island . If you havn ' t , i ' ts a website for all the students in the @ LOCATION1 to take online courses for math , reading , and science . They are time consuming , but they count for a huge chunk of our grade . So , if we get an @ CAPS2 on study island we get an @ CAPS2 in one of our classes . Not only does the computer help students but it helps me in a kind of personal way . I love the piano . But , there are no instructions in my area . However , there is a program on the computer called synewnisia . It helps you learn all kinds of songs on your keyboard or piano . The piano helps my hand - eye coordination as we will as it teaches discipline and dedication . Now , synewnesia is not the only free instrument learning program . There are many others ! This helps people who can not afford lessons , and learning an instrument can help you acheive things later in life . Now , one thing you said in your article is that people are not getting enough exercise because of sitting in front of a computer all day . This is not completly true . In fact , most people go on the computer researching diet plans or local gyms . How do I know this ? we will one day when I went on google the top search of the day was , "" weight watchers diet plan "" . Also , my mom uses an online video workout website , for her bad back . So not only does the computer help for diets , they can help physical therapy also . So with this letter I hope you realize that the computer does benifite our society , yes , we should not spend too much time on it . But , online learning sessions can be time consuming .

In my opinion , no computers definitely do not make people lazy and less interactive with others aroud them . First , I think that computers can sometimes make you smarter .

A survey conducted by the @ CAPS2 school social studies teacher shows that @ PERCENT1 of their students used teh computers to find facts for school projects . @ PERCENT2 out of that @ PERCENT1 end up getting better grades .

I remember when I was in @ NUM1 grade I made a new friend and she moves to @ LOCATION1 in the @ DATE1 after @ NUM2 grade . I keep in touch with her on @ CAPS3 .

"" I know you @ MONTH1 be thinking that people do not need to keep in touch with their families all the time but it makes them happier . Therefore people need computers so they can keep in touch with their families . Third , you can learn new exercise , moves or tricks . I mean you can do new exercise , train for dance competition or learn new magic tricks for you magic show . I remember when I wanted to learn how to twirl a balon between my fingers I went and found a video of someone teaching step by step on how to do it . it is easier now .

Also , @ PERSON1 , from @ ORGANIZATION1 says "" @ CAPS2 people believe that using the computer gives you benefits , but they do not .

I implore the citizens of the @ LOCATION1 area to cut down on internet time and go outside to enjoy nature .

The ove useage of computers is a huge problem . Have you ever sat infront of a computer screen for hours on end ? If so , you know the feeling of sleepiness and irritability . The lack of exercise while using a computer impacts people more than they realize . Excessive use of ocmputers has been linked to obesity and high blood pressure . the more people use the computer , the higher their blood pressure . Just sitting infront of a screen is terrible for people ' s bodies . To stay healty , only use the computer when it is absolutely neccesary . Going on all the time can seperate you from others . This g eneration , adolecents especailly , use the computer to comunicate with others more than actually talking to them . Communicateing only over the computer can draw them away from people socially . Not ot mention how fast rumors and secrets spread over the internet . Useing the computer can ruin relationships even those with family . Being neglegent of family by always being on the computer can draw people apart . Families can became a non - important thing . People can not pay atttention to their families while sucked into a computer screen . Computers are creating false substitutes for almost everthing , even nature . Humans started out living i nthe wild , gathering food from the land and giving back by raplanting . Our connection with nature was strong . We needed it to thrive . Nowadays , however , instead of listening to the sound of rain and the crinkling of dry leaves , people prefer high pitched artificial beeping and the classic "" you have got mail .

Life cannot exist with nothing to thrive off of . We can hop on our computers and look at pictures of nature on @ ORGANIZATION1 . com , or we can grab our shoes and see it for ourselves . No one can experience the greatness of nature while on the computer . No one can experience the feel of cool lake water sliding over their skin or a hot @ DATE1 day while emailing a friend . It can not be done . Computers have robbed us of our ability to experience creature . In conclusion , computers are horrid for people .

As i mentioned , everyone who is using a computer on a daily basis , will drop their communication skills . People enter chat rooms not knowing who they are talking to . For example , if i logged onto & chat room , someone might ask for personal information such as where you live , your phone number & your name . This could lead to things such as kidnaping & even rape . Also , interactions with family members & friends @ MONTH1 decrease . You can be playing a computer game , online , or going on youtube to watch random videos of people . You tube in said to be a dangerous site for younger children .

9493,743,1,"To use computors , or not to . That is the question . Hundreds of millions of people use computors in their daily life today , but some believe that using computors does not benefit society . It is my firm beleif that they do . Computors provide entertainment , a way to interact with people , and a nearly endless expand of knowledge . Without them , we would quickly find life to be much harder and less fun to navigate . Have you ever been in your house on a rainy day just sitting around bored because there is nothing on @ CAPS1 ? we will I have on many ocations . When that happens , all you have to do is turn on the computer and you have endless choices at your fingertips . You can go on game sites and play thousands of different games . ( this can also help improve your hand - eye coordination ) . You can also watch movies or @ CAPS1 shows that you missed or want to watch again . You can even go on sites such as fanfiction . net , and read or write your own stories ! Another reason why computers benifit society is that they help you interact with people . You can keep in touch with far away family members and friends using webcams email , and chat sites without the bill that would come with talking on the phone . You can also meet new people from different countries and become their . That way you learn about different ways of life and cultures .

9496,85,1,"Dear local newspaper , Computers are they a good benifit for society or a bad benifit for society ? What do you think would you enjoy always being on the computer ? I would not , so this is why I believe that computers have a negative impact on society . First reason why I think computers have a negative impact is because you can become addicted to always having to be on the computer . Becoming addicted to the computer leads to serious consequences . For example you spend less time exercising and that is not healthy for your body physically . Not exercising leads to many things like being over weight , health problems , diseases like dieabeties , and many other things , but usually these are the main problems . You can aviode this by turning of the computer and just go for a small walk , but because of what computers have to offer now these day people want do this . that is one reason why computers have a negative impact on the society . Another reason for why computers have a negative impact on society is because you will not spend as much time with your friends and family . Even if you do not know this if you spend more time on the computer than with your family and friends this affects them in many ways . They can feel dissapointed worried about you , even concerned . When you are always on the computer you are ignoring your family and this hurts them emotionally . Think about how would you feel if you had a best friend you always hung out with . You two did everthing together , and the all of a sudden your best friend suddenly stops calling you ; or visiting you and hanging out with you . You would feel dissapointed because you loss your best friend over a computer . These things can happen if you go overboard when using the computer . This is why is think computers do not do good they do more harm in my personal opinion . The final reason why I say that computers are not way good is for a main reason safty . Those days computers have all the websites like @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 , twitter , and others . There are so many kids who chat with people they do not even know . Also they are posting pictures of themselves without even thinking that this is a dangerous thing to do . Once you post those pictures they will always be there no matter if you even try to delete them . Another thing when you are on the computer people do not even think about their safty and that is how things happen . For example you can think you are talking to a friend but as it turns out you were talking to some stranger . Then you go meet up with your friend when it really was not . So you see safty is a real big problem with these computers . that is why I believe computers have a really negative impact on society . As a result , do you still believe that computers are a good beifit for society or bad beifit ? My opinion stillis the same and I am sure that there are others who believe the same . So this is why I think that computers are a bad benifit for society , and that computers can lead to more harm than do any good for people who use the computer .",10.0,208,4.877383330318335,18.06451612903226,31,0.3707664884135473,6.0,1.6167557932263814,0.9629004147713268,0.0142602495543672,31.0

I recently heard that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising , and enjoying nature .

So the computer does a lot for people , give ' s them the chance to learn new thing , a chance to chat with friends far away , and also expand your mind of travel . Computers can do a lot for a person ' s life of know ' lleage . Just yesterday I found out that the human body can not survive without it is liver . The computer also helped me with my strugle ' s in math , even though that is what the teacher is for she is not always their , like when I am home or away on vacation and I just want to remember so thing ' s in math . it is also help ' s people who want to know new launage ' s such as @ CAPS2 , @ CAPS3 , and @ CAPS4 . So you see a computer has a big affect on a person ' s life . Two days ago I did a video chat with my grandparents back in @ LOCATION2 it was great . After six year ' s not seeing my grandparents they really changed , and I was starting to forget what they looked like . I never knew that a computer could do a video chat from so far away I was surprised . I do not know why you experts are so concerned about computer taking away people ' s live ' s look what it has done for my family .

9498,1693,1,"Dear Newspaper , Have you notice that now a days more and more people are becoming overweight ? we will it is true . People say that it is because of eat a lot of fast food but I think that since we are always on the computer and not excersing helps contribute to it . Also as the technology is getting better it is keeping people from going outside and enjoying the beautiful nature . Sitting infront of the computer is not going to help our environment . Lastly , kids are not getting out of their house to interact with friends and family because technology has been able to let us communicate without leaving our house . @ CAPS1 not saying that we should downgrade our technology , but we need to find a way limit it . To start on with , technology has a role in the increasing rate of obesity . Some @ MONTH1 say that people chose not to excerise but if we limit things then they will not have to chose . As a kid myself , I love to be on the computer . My parents are always trying to get the computer and take the dogs for a walk and I always say "" @ CAPS1 busy "" @ CAPS2 it is true , I do not really like to go outside because I have a computer to play games or talk to friends and to be honest excersing to me seems important but I do not do it because I am always on the computer . I think that other people could feel this way so that is why we need to limit the computer . Secondly , global warming is occuring right now and people would rather be inside on the computer then go outside and enjoy the nature . @ CAPS2 , you @ MONTH1 be able to look up ways to stop global warming , but does it mean you are going to really do it ? Some @ MONTH1 not because they could just stay on the computer and keep "" @ CAPS3 up "" ways to help another things is that when we use our computers , we use electricity , which adds to global warming so it we limit the use of computers then people could go enjoy nature and not destroy it . Lastly , internet sites like myspace , @ CAPS4 , @ CAPS5 , etc have allowed us to communicate with friends and family but we are still not able to get out and interact with them . When we get out and interact with our friends we gain like communication teamwork and respect friend and family can teach you this with them the computer they can not . Also interacting with your family and friend @ MONTH1 let you go in new places that you have not been before and on the computer you can not go there . Interacting with friends & family is better than talk thru the computer . In conclusion if we stay on the computer then we will not get excerise enjoy nature or interact with friends .

We all use them for communication , entertainment , and knowledge . Computers are like people with fun to do and things to learn . Computers are beneficial to everyone worldwide . Computers gradually advance communication more and more everyday . It used to be old letters by mail , then it became e - mails , twitter , and facebook . These websites upgrage communication today . Long distance friends can view photos , information , videos , and chat from far away . Some site like @ ORGANIZATION2 allow you to instant message your friends . Lastly , video chatting is a new improved way to see a live video of the other person . According to @ ORGANIZATION1 @ NUM1 more user signed up for web - cams since the beggining of @ DATE1 . Communication is positively affected by computers . I know you @ MONTH1 have fun with sports or nature , but sometimes it is great to get great entertainment for yourself instantly . Computer games only cost about @ MONEY1 and are instant access . Also , surfing the web for news or funny videos is fun sometimes . Almost everyone who has a @ CAPS2 gets a blast surfing the internet . Do you ever wonder how to hear the song you like when it is not on the radio ? Itunes stores , organize , and plays music in a virtual library for permanent access . What also happens is youtube allows you to watch music videos or hear songs for free .

Another reason is because there is some history on many different websites . My last reason is because you can send messages to a faraway place by using e - mail . My frist reason states that there is a lot more information on the internet . For example , if youn do not have the newspaper with you , but you have you laptop , you can get information that way . Did you know , over @ NUM1 , @ NUM2 people use their laptops for information and not games . Another example is if we get the newspaper everyday but it does not have the article that we are looking for , we use the internet . When we look for information on the internet , you would use yahoo , google , and other informational websites that you need . My second reason states that there is some history on many different websites . For instance , you can go on a websites and learn about history everyday , insted of going to a museum about history everyday ! One day , I had to make a project about the @ CAPS4 and I had four days to do it , you know what I did , I went on a historical website about the @ CAPS4 . I got an A + for my project . When people need history , it is always all around them on the internet . My very last reason states that insted of texting people from faraway places , why not just use an e - mail address . For example , you do not have to pay for an e - mail address . it is actually free and did you know , more than @ NUM3 million people around the world use an e - mail address insted of texting other people . When you do not have an e - mail address , it is very quick to make one . You do not have to waste money to text someone halfway around the globe . In conclusion , I think that we should have computers . One reason is that we have a lot more information on the internet . Another reason is because there is some history on some websites . And my last reason is because you can send messages to a far away place by using e - mail .

9501,558,1,"Some "" experts "" are warned that people should spend too much time on their computers . Yet , look at all of the advantages to a computer . You can develop better hand - eye coordination skills , internet with friends / family who could live hundreds of miles away , and you can learn about cultures all around the world , along with the people who live in those countries , without ever leaving home . In my oponion , computers overall benefit society , helping us learn more & more every day . First off , there are many skills you can develop on the computer . For example , when playing interactive high - paced games , kids get a sense of awareness timing , and hand - eye coordination . Not to mention , with new advances in technology , people can now go to college without ever leaving home , and at a much lower price , while still getting a great education . Many people even work from home , thanks to their computers . These are still only a few of the many skills that can be learned on computers . Secondly , why buy a ticket to a far away country that is fairly expensive , trade in all your money for the money they have there , go through the hasslels of baggage , ect . When you could simply go online and look it up on the computer ? You can go online , look up some of that countries recipes , language , pictures , people without the hassel of going there . Not to mention , for kids who are not old enough to @ LOCATION1 , or have to do a report on it , instead of making through countless textbooks , newspapers , libraries in general , they go online , @ CAPS1 their country , and they have must , if not all the info they need right there . So not only is getting the information then you would have learned in the first place , thereby , extending your knowledge . Finally , the internet helps people connect . Leading experts from the @ CAPS2 . S . A . or Family security agency , says that since people have started using programs like @ ORGANIZATION1 and facebook , many more families , who live in different countries , have been able to re - coonect and get to know one - another . For example , if you have an uncle who lives in @ LOCATION1 , you could both buy cameras for your computer , install them , and within minutes , be seeing each other / talking face to face . I think this is better then simply writing letters to them , as it is quicker , and you get to connect more . Same goes if a friend or you move away , but want to stay in touch . A quick facebook account or @ ORGANIZATION1 , and you will still be good friends . So all in all , yes , computers do benefit society , as they help teach people skills , learn about distant cultures / far away countries , and connect people , who might live in different countries . I do not see anything wrong with these beneficial factors to society .

To conclude , computers have a positive effect on people . Did you know hand - eye coordination can be helpful at times ? we will , it true because if you are in distress and the phone is broken and you do not have a cellphone then send an emergency e - mail to one of your friends informing them to call all and since you have hand - eye coordination you can type without having to look down . Also if your in college and have an important essay due tomorrow then hand - eye coordination can really help you write down notes without having to look back at the writing paper . Finally , with hand - eye coordination it can help you can join the army because if you spot a threat you can aim and shoot quickly without having to take out the gun after threat attacks . To conclude , computers teaches hand - eye coordination .

Fethermore , if you want to learn to speak a forgein language you can all you have to do is type in the language with a question and search it is so easy a baby can do it . Finally , if you want to learn how to cook like forgein places do then type in the type of food or it is name and search . To summarize , computers lets people know about forgein places . Have you ever have the feeling that you want to talk to somebody ? I know I have this is why computers can help you talk to people online just tree the person ' s e - mail adresses and type the message . Also you do not have to waste money on paper and envelopes .

Not only that but you should notice the great potential the computer has for showing us distant , faraway lands and cultures . What would we be able to @ CAPS1 without hand eye cooridination ? Nothing that is what we could @ CAPS1 . Without the hand eye cooridination that computers and video games help you develop , you would not even be able to go outside and enjoy a peaceful game of tennis , baseball , or even basketball all because without hand eye coordination you are clumbsy and your depth perception is off .

There is no way you will get it done in time and have it be legible ; and worse is that you will be fired or expelled if it is not done . But your savior has arrived ! The computer improves peoples hand writing , speed , and research all at the click of a few buttons . With computers theirs no more need for long tedious hours of handwriting or seaching through books at the library . What would happen to us with out this wonderful invention ?

You can interact and make more friends by talking or web chating . Not to forget that it is more entertaning . That is what computers were made for . To help us with tasks or for our personal use . How do computers though help us with work ? Lets say that you are having a buisness meeting and you have to write a five page report with pictures and a graphs . It would take you twice the time to do that by hand then with a computer . With a computer , you can type you work which makes it much neater and looks more proffesional , You can copy and paste your images that you can @ CAPS1 on the internet . With graph making software , you can easily plug in the data you have collected and the computer will do the rest .

Then you would have to make the graph by hand making sure not to mess up . It makes it twice as hard , to do a simple task with a computer . What if you want to talk to a friend ? With a computer you can easily talk to a friend as to having to write a letter or talk on the phone with a computer you can either chat with a person with writing or even being able to see them on you computer screen . Instead of just hearing voice or waiting two or three days to talk to them . If you have a laptop you can talk to them were every they go or you go . Being able to see the person at your convinience to talk without having to leave you house is a very good thing to have . The benifit are major and it does not cost anything to chat . If you have a friend or relative that lives very far away , you can easily go at talk and have a video conference . What about entertainment ? The computer is a very valuable too ! but we can fun , we can play games or watch videos at as convinience . They do not cost a lot to download at all , they can be played with friends on a web chat or by yourself . Videos you can watch all the time with no ads to interupt you can pause the video too . This is more efficie , they care I very convinient for the average person . Playing games were ever you go is good and again do not art to play or .

Finally , as the earthquake in @ LOCATION1 I was able to donate through the @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 website .

With the computer it teaches hand - eye cordination , gives people the ability to learn about far away places , and it gives people the ability to talk to each other . I belive the @ CAPS4 technology of the computer is defidently helping out society . To start , computers are helping many people with their hand eye coordination . As you know hand eye coordination is necsicarry for a good driver . The @ CAPS4 statistics that came out from "" @ CAPS2 drivers . com "" the rate of accidents has decreased over the past ten years . In fact it decraced over @ PERCENT1 . With all the computer games that they have for young kids it is improving kids hand eye coordination . Starting at a young age . With the games like "" @ CAPS3 "" a majority of kids are ridding bikes skiing or snow boarding by five years old . All of these activities require very good hand eye coordination . Lastly , the resources that help with hand eye coordination are being used to help special - ed students get better at simple tasks at a faster pase . Secondly the world wide web is teaching people of all ages about places that are located thousands of miles away from their homes . Something that I personaly use my computer for is to research a location and find history on it before I go on vacation to that place . The computers in our school has helped our classes in social studies . My teacher @ PERSON1 said that he has been grading more strictly often and the grades are still up by @ PERCENT2 on computer and internet research projects . I should also add in that using the computers our school is in communication with a school in @ LOCATION1 . Once a week we email our pen - pa . the computers have deffidently helped my schools curriculum . Finally , computers are letting people of all ages talk to buisness partners , friends etc . The social networking sites have kept @ PERCENT3 of friends in touch found in "" @ CAPS4 - tech "" magazine . I should also add in it has reconected @ PERCENT4 of friends from high school all due to the computer . Another form of online talking is vidio chatting which many people are now using for buissness meetings instead of spending the money to fly to the location of their meeting . Now , for one day you should track how many hours you are on the computer for your job . I can bet the number is going to be about @ PERCENT5 of the time you are in you office .

First of all compters are important because as our world gets more technilque inclined compters are need for almost every job and you will want people to know how to work a computer . Police officers use compters to find want criminals and put criminals into the computer to keep them on files . Schools use computers everyday for kids to do reports on , find information , and do homework on too . As a student I know that kids use computers all the time . For example @ TIME1 I used computers to do my math homeworks that my teacher assigned me . After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me . Secondly you have the ability to research places all over the world . Another good thing with computers is that you can look up the news and be updated everything that is going on right now . Computers are just great to use because if you do not like write you have a computer and you might even get it done faster if you are a good and fast type . I use computers to do all my essays and book reports for @ LOCATION1 I also use it for look at the news to see ehats going on in the world . Lastly computers are get because they allow you to talk to people online . You can either email them or talk to them from a web cam . Online chat is good to keep in touch with a friend from far away or even ask a friend ehat the homework was tonight .

9515,1494,1,"Dear editor , Computers are one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race . They benefit society in every way imaginable , and have numerous positive affects on people . Computers improve hand eye coordination , allow people to learn about many subjects that books do not give them acess to , and allow millions of people every day to talk and communicate with friends and family . The most important use for computers is learning . Using computers , billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before . Many people like myself check the weather on the computer daily , making sure we are prepared or dressed appropriatly for the weather . Without computers , I would not be able to do this . Also , on days when it snows during the night , I always check the school ' s website when I wake up in order to ensure that school is still on . This is a helpful resource and I do not know what I ' d do without it . Another thing computers allow us to do is check the news . With the click of your mouse , you can check to see who won the presidency , or what shows are on tonight . Another amazing aspect of computers is that they improve eye - hand coordination greatly . This not only benifits my mom who checks her email five times every minute , but my little three year old sister who loves to move the mouse around , and type in random letters on documents . It could entertain her for days , but most importantly , it helps improve her eye - hand coordination every second she sits in that chair . This improved skill will help her enourmously in her future when she soon begins to play sports , and ride bikes . Finally , computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily at no cost . If classmates forgot to write down homework they can email the teacher instantly , and know exactly what the homework is and even open the sheet that the teacher attached , and print it out . A couple of weeks ago , my dad went to @ LOCATION1 for thirteen days , and it was outragously expensive to talk to him on his phone . So , every couple days , he video chatted with me instead so I could talk to him . hear what he was doing , and even see the view of @ LOCATION2 from his window . This was very special to me and could not have been done without computers . As it is so plainly clear , computers help us in so many ways that we forget about like educating us , improving our eye hand coordination , and allowing us to communicate with friends and family . These are just a couple of the positive affects and benifits that computers provide us with .",10.0,235,4.408728235566888,19.91304347826087,23,0.5119825708061002,6.0,1.6034858387799564,1.208830175294948,0.013071895424836602,23.0
9516,1544,1,"I People spend too much time on the computer . A lot of people are on the computer for about the whole day . They should be spending time with family and friends . People never have enough time for activities . Also computer should mostly be used for talking with family and friends , homework , research , games @ CAPS1 bored , and work . To begin with , people need to spend more time with family and friends rather than on the computer . For example @ CAPS1 your mother or father asked you @ CAPS1 you wanted to go out to dinner and you said no , I am on the computer , that would just mean your obsessed with going on the computer . A lot of families are bing broken apart because people spend too much time on the computer @ CAPS1 you have a friend over and they say I am bored and all you are doing is play games on the computer than that is just being rude because your friend is bored . So you need to get off the computer and spend time with your loved ones . Previously I stated how people spend time with loved ones , we will people need to spend more time doing activities as we will . A lot of humans sit on the computer and eat so over the time they eventually get fat . @ CAPS1 you are gaining weight because your on the computer than you need to go do some activite to off that fat . @ CAPS1 you are a teen and you are given the idea to play a sport and you it because computer is more important then is some serious obesession with the computer . As a result , the computer should be used wisely . The computer should be used to talk to family and friends , homework , research , work , and @ CAPS1 you bored play some games little games on the computer . Those are probably the most important things that should most likely used for the computer . A lot of these things that I have listed are important because @ CAPS1 you go on the computer just to be on and watch people talk then what is the point of wasting your time on the computer when you could be doing much more different things on the computer . For example , @ CAPS1 you have homework such as vocabulary and you need definitions you can go to www . dictionary . com to find them , or @ CAPS1 you just need to define a simple word . In conclusion , people spend too much time on the computer . They need to be spending more time with family and friends . Also people need to be doing more activities in their lives . Lastly , you should use the computer for useful things like homework or even very important research . So , as you can see humans spend too much time on the computer rather than doing much more important things .",10.0,159,4.3789648950164715,18.92,25,0.3354430379746836,5.0,1.5675105485232068,1.4009242772281592,0.006329113924050633,25.0
9518,1287,1,"To begin with , The learning ability people get from it has improved . The @ CAPS1 source is very helpful to many people . The communication is much easier than talking on the phone . I believe that computers benefit the society in many different ways . First of all , children and people at home and at school use computers for learning purposes . In some grades at school there is a special typing program that helps improve typing skills . There are also hard drive discs that you can play with to help you enhance on your reading skills . It is just a way to make learning fun for young kids . Another great way to learn online is going to websites that have sample math problem and print the sheet out to practice . They are great ways to help learning . Secondly , the computer has many more ways to benifit someone . They are helpful for getting your local weather . In the winter you can see if your school has cancelled in seconds . Often I get projects where it calls for me to do research on a specific topic and it is very easy to look up simple information . The computer also has different links that are helpful for writing a paper , making a power point presentation , and excel spread sheet . All of those resources can either help graphing results for science class or even typing up a paper for @ CAPS2 . They are useful ways to make life easier . Lastly , computers tend to make communication a little easier . For me , when I am out sick from school I like to tell my teachers by emailing them and even asking if I can make up any work using facebook , aim , myspace , and skype are all fun and fast ways to communicate with friends . All of the websites pretty much do the same thing but different people like diffrent sites that their friends are on you can email friends and family who live far away and even close . it is a way to get back and forth to eachother . In conclusion , you have heard the different ideas and I consider computers as a benifit .

9520,326,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , I believe that computers are one of the most useful things that we can have . First , computers are good for communicating . Students @ MONTH1 contact teachers through email if they have a question about an assignment . Computers also are useful for teaching . People use the @ CAPS2 everyday to get information on their favorite sports teams or on a new recipe they saw on television . Finally , computers help us get work done easier . Student and employees use @ ORGANIZATION1 for everything from writing a paper to creating a presentation . Futhermore , computers are extremely essential to our everyday life because they help us communicate , learn and finish work . Every year , thousands of students go to college , and thousands of families move away from each other . Computers are one way of communicating to @ CAPS8 loved ones in far away places . Parents send messages via email to their children at college . Families speak with each other through @ CAPS3 . Computers are what makes all this possible . Not only can we use computers to make contact with our families , but we can also use them to speak with our teachers . Whenever a student is sick , but wants to get their homework finished , they look on their teacher ' s website . Here , all the homework for the class is listed . Also , if a student has a paper due the @ DATE1 , but their printer is broken , they @ MONTH1 email the paper to the teacher . This allows the student to get full credit for their work . Email is not onlyuseful for handing in projects , but also for asking questions about the assignments . If a student has a question about an assignment , he or she can ask a friend or the teacher . Then , the student will be able to successfully complete the project . Computers are one of the most useful ways of making contact today , but communication is not the computer ' s only purpose . The average person goes on the @ CAPS2 ten times a @ DATE1 just to get information . Computers provide a pletvera of knowledge for people ' s use . Search engines like @ ORGANIZATION3 or yahoo provide answers in less than one second . This is much faster than going in the library and spending an hour looking it up . Website text is not the anything that provides information far eager learners @ CAPS5 also provide pictures to further the persons understanding about a topic . For example , if a person is living in the @ LOCATION1 , and has lived there all their life , but is reading an article on a website about an animal native to @ LOCATION2 , they would not know how to picture it in their head . Articles and books @ MONTH1 provide a description , nut nothing really gives the person a solid picture . The person could go online and search for a picture , which they will surely find . Finally , computers keep the brain active . While searching on a website , a person could piece together information from different sites to create a better picture , and , therefore , have a more complete and thorough understanding . In order to do this , however , a person ' s brain must constantly working . This helps develop skills later on such as problem solving . Overall , computers are one of the most useful and common of the learning devices . Many people say that computers are useful . They agree this by saying that work gets done so much easier and faster on a computer . on average , computers complete work fifty times more efficiently than people do by hand . This is because of programs such as @ CAPS6 , @ CAPS7 , and @ ORGANIZATION2 @ ORGANIZATION2 @ CAPS8 programs allow people to cerrect spelling and grammatical mistakes while at the same time creating a neat looking presentation . Studies show that @ PERCENT1 of people with bad spelling or grammatical habits corrected @ CAPS8 mistakes quickly through @ ORGANIZATION2 and @ CAPS6 .

9525,1104,1,"Dear Readers , @ CAPS1 of the most important inventions of the past decades is the computer , and it has it is pros and cons . I think people spend to much time on computers , especially teenagers . They spend to much time on @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3 , and not enough time outside enjoying nature and playing sports or exercising . While they @ MONTH1 talk with friends with @ CAPS4 , it is not the same as going to the park with friends and playing a game of baseball . Families also are distant form each other when they sit around on @ CAPS5 . Teenagers spend too much time on the @ CAPS6 going where they should instead of doing more benefitul activities like reading . I sure we all know at least @ CAPS1 obese person or teenager . My neighbor is the size of a killer whale and eats just about as much as @ CAPS1 . He will sit on the computer chair and stare with his eyes glazed at the computer chair and stare with his eyes glazed at the computer screen for hours on end . Sometimes I wonder how many brain cells he wastes per second . I will bet that everyone who reads this knows someone like my neighbor . The statistic @ PERCENT1 of @ LOCATION2 is obese is not exagrated at all . In my opinion , it is the fault of the @ CAPS6 and computers . Instead of going to the gym or the soccer field with friends , they got to the computer and talk and eat junk food . They spend their time watching pointless @ CAPS5 videos , while they should be playing baseball or football . Doubters say you learn hand - eye cordination with computers , but you can learn better with sports . Computers are a large factor in obesity because they encourage @ CAPS1 to sit around instead of doing standard @ NUM1 minutes a day of exercise . The next pressing issue is the amount of reading the average teenager and @ CAPS9 does . I would say that the average gets about @ NUM2 minutes of reading a day because they are to busy chating with friends on the @ CAPS6 . I have a cousin who reads about a book every @ NUM3 years and fail every test he gets and has stayed back @ NUM4 times , but instead of reading and learning , he is chating and texting . He wastes these excellent educational opportunitys while their are people in underdevolped countries like @ LOCATION3 who are lucky to own a book . I know more than @ PERCENT2 of the kids in my class do not read anything execpt the required reading and that is because they sit around on the computers wasting @ CAPS10 is about @ NUM5 and that number is decreasing because of the lack of reading done and the time on computers spent . I have seen survey that say @ NUM6 out of @ NUM7 spend more than @ NUM6 hours a day on computers . These statistics and quotes have left me thinking , how much time do we really need to spend on computers instead of reading or else we will turn into oversized monkey who can not even rad . The computers and @ CAPS6 are doing more than just erasing brain cell and are health , they are taking away the expriences that we could have outside in nature . Nature holds natural wonders like the @ ORGANIZATION1 , the @ CAPS11 @ CAPS12 and the @ CAPS13 @ CAPS14 . What beats sking down a large slope , or climbing the @ LOCATION1 , certainly not computers . Unfortunatly , that what most @ CAPS15 choose to do . They sit and tap on the keyboard instead of walking nature trails and walking on the beaches . They sit on old moldy chairs and stare at computer screens , unlike the people enjoying the butterfly gardens and wildlife preserves . Instead of taking steps to help the enviorment we are siting on the computers sleeping and being mesmerized by the light of the screen . We should be preserving and learning abouy what is left on the planet , but we are not because of these computes and the @ CAPS6 . I have present a strong arguement against computers that you @ MONTH1 listen to or not . I strongly urge you to take action to start reduce time on computers spent .

This is no coinfidence , computers are causing more and more people to challenge themselves to nex that extra mile , or swim that extra lap , and instead so home and play on their computers . This not only is hurting peoples ' weights , but excersize equipment store owners are having to close their shops , because less and less people are coming into work out , or excersize like they should everyday ! Our children are also being affected by this addicting sensation , childhood obesity is one of the main effects on children , because when they get heard playing on these they as we will stop excersizing , and play videogames . The average amount of people who went to @ LOCATION2 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 every year was around @ NUM1 , but since the invention of the computer that the attendance dropped to a more @ NUM2 people every year .

I know @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 colleges expect students to turn in there assignements threw the computers or it is a zero . In this society theres no time for zeros because when you are in college your still paying for the class even if your failing or not . So basically it is a waste of money .

9543,723,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 , I would like to notify your business that computers benefit society . Computers allow people to talk to friends and family , they are important resources for many jobs as we will as school work , and they allow people to learn and store information . Computers are one of the biggest advances we have in technology . First and foremost , computers allow people to talk to friends and family . I like to go on the computer , mostly because I am able to speak with my friends . Computers are a good way to talk to friends that you @ MONTH1 not see often or just to talk at the appropriate time . I have a facebook and I always talk to my friends about events happining in school or school work . For instance , last month I sprained my ankle and I stayed home from school for one day . So I went on facebook at around @ TIME1 , when everyone was home from school and my friend told me what was for homework that night . So , now because of our computers I could catch up on the work that I missed that day of school . Also , if you have family that lives far away or someone in college you can send them an email to keep in touch . My cousin is in college right now and I always talk to him on the computer to see how he is doing . For example , we always talk about sports we are involved with during that time of year . As you can see , computers are a great way to keep in touch with family and talk to friends . Secondly , computers are a big part of many peoples lives because many jobs involve computers ; as we will as school . Computers are a very useful piece of technology because people use computers for paying bills , jobs and more . For example , my dad tests computer programs as a job . The programs are constructed , then corrected and revised , then finally sent out all over the world . If people weren ' t allowed to use computers then many people would lose their jobs and many families would be in huge debt . Also , children do a lot of school work on the computer . For example , I take spanish and I earn culture points for my class by answering a question on the computer . Studies show that over @ PERCENT1 of children use computers for some sort of school work . Computers are a big part of the working society today . Finally , computers allow people to learn about different places around the world . The computer holds a lot of valuble information . There is facts and fasinating pictures about different countries . It also shows people around the world the culture , style , language and many more facts about places around the world . For instance , my uncle was on the computer one day and he was looking at places in @ LOCATION1 and after a long hard thinking process him and his family moved there and they still live there to this day .

9545,557,1,"Dear , editor of the @ ORGANIZATION1 . I beleive that computers are good for the future . The world has made many chenges with there technology . I know not spending time exercising is bad but learning about new things can not be that bad . If humans did not have technology some of us would not have heat or fresh water . We use computers in life . Computers are good for people who use them to learn about the world . Some people who have friends far away can use a computer to talk to them . Or even people who can not talk use computers to talk for them . The @ ORGANIZATION2 uses computers to save lives . Computers save lifes in so many ways it is scary to think if they were all gone we could all start dying . We use computers in hospitals if there weren ' t any computers the chances of finding a cure for something would take to long and the person could die . Lets say someone has what looks like a normal fever and you just say that is what they have . Two days later they died because they had some disease and no one knew until it was to late . We use computers to purify water . We use computers to keep us warm during winter . We even use computers in libraries why the library . Some people who have medical illnesses and can not talk have these little computers that can have something typed in them and it would say it . Most people use some kind of computer to talk , chat , and text . They might find it easier with a computer . The worlds a big place and many people do not know much about it . But if you go online you could find out stuff that you @ MONTH1 never knew exsited of just plainly did not know about it . Kids even use computers for school and school work . So many people rely on technology to get through there life . Computers even help people in school for people like me who broke there arm and have to take some test on the computer . Like me . Now so many things in the military , airforce , and @ ORGANIZATION3 are computerized . The miltary uses thermal sights on guns and tanks so they can identify people in even the most craziest weather . It could even locate a wounded soldier . There even working with computers to make better bullet prove vest so they will be more lives saved in war . The airforce uses computers to talk to people on the ground so they could protect them . They now have planes that can be flown by a man far away and this would save there lives even if it gets shot down . This also alows them to see people hiding and they could tell the people on the ground to stay down or whatever . The @ ORGANIZATION3 uses radar to see if there is any boats or submarines coming near them and the have a heads up if there would be an attack . We use this to help with other advances in the future we could soon have a computer that could help out people in far places like were there is a higher poverty rate . Computers save lives , alows communication , and is a good way for research . Computers is what we use to live we need them to survive .",10.0,240,5.026332579158573,15.08108108108108,37,0.4293381037567084,5.0,1.5384615384615383,1.5079816531097694,0.01610017889087657,37.0
9546,101,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , Have you ever gone somewhere , taken pictures , and posted them on the computer ? If you have you will remember where you visited . But atleast you went to @ ORGANIZATION1 , or @ LOCATION1 or somewhere . There are some people who are on the computer all day . Instead of experiencing nature and taken on @ CAPS1 life brings to them , they are on facebook or youtube all day . This disgusts me because there are many fun , beautiful , and entertainings things to do . In @ CAPS2 opinion I think computers have negative effects on people . People miss out on enjoying nature or interacting with friends and family . Some people do not get exercise anymore and it hurts to see obese people just sit ther and do nothing about there lives . First I ' d like to talk about obesity . Did you know that @ PERCENT1 of children are obese at young a young age ? Computers take the place of exercising for a young boy or girl . They should go outside and play sports like basketball or soccer . Another thing is those game websites . Children get so caught up in a computer game , everything around them just disappears . All they worry about is winning the game . While playing this game they might eating doritos . Sooner or later five pounds is gained . Then they will regret not exercising and not be able to move . Later in life , when things are bad for them , they will realized on how many fantastic things they missed . Then they will say "" @ CAPS1 did I do with @ CAPS2 life ? "" @ CAPS2 next point shows that people are not enjoying nature . Have you ever taken a nice walk in the park ? I know I have . we will people sit inside all day just taking a peek out the window , but do not think about going outside . Nature is beautiful , smells nice , even refreshing at times . But no . People sit on there butt all day . On the computer accomplishing absolutely nothing . Why can not they go outsite for a walk or a jog ? People can see animals like squirrels climbing up a tree . How cute . But instead they play a virtual game where you shoot squirrels with a paint ball gun . So much is missed because of computers . As much as not enjoying nature upsets me , some people blow off their own family just to watch a re - run of family guy on youtube . @ CAPS1 have we come to ? Some children hit their parents because the parents shut the computer off . I ' d rather enjoy a meal with @ CAPS2 family and then just sit down , relax , and talk . Also some people do not get sleep becuse they are "" doing something important "" and miss a family trip or even school .

9549,1772,1,"Dear Newspaper Readers , @ CAPS1 many hours a day do you spend on the computer ? In this modern world , @ CAPS2 @ MONTH1 seem hard for you to tear away from that trusty computer screen and face life . Nearly everyone in @ LOCATION1 has a computer , about @ PERCENT1 , and @ CAPS2 is ruining our country . With all these hours wasted in the virtual world , people are lacking in exercise , leading to many problems . They are also avoiding nature outside , and losing contact with family and friends . I think that computers are causing way too many problems and peerhaps , with some consideration @ ORGANIZATION1 my evidence , you could come to think the same . Statistically , the @ ORGANIZATION1 is the most overweight country . One @ ORGANIZATION1 the reasons ? Hours @ ORGANIZATION1 sitting at the computer replaces healthy exercise @ CAPS3 are all spending our lives on the computer , and sitting and clicking is not exercise . The great lack @ ORGANIZATION1 exercise is causing health problems . Not exercising can lead to abesity , which damages joints terribly . Then , diabetes developes , taking away from the quality @ ORGANIZATION1 your life . Finally , there is heart disease , a top killer in our country . All this from spending time on the computer ? you @ MONTH1 ask @ CAPS4 the amount @ ORGANIZATION1 time @ CAPS3 spend on computers is much more damaging than this . Every day is beautiful in it is own way , and sometimes @ CAPS2 is beautiful to us , in saying that beautiful to us ( when @ CAPS2 comes to the outdoors ) is clear skys and a warm - temperature . These days come quite often , but what does @ ORGANIZATION1 do ? Glance out the window and go back to texting on that @ ORGANIZATION2 laptop . Our bodies need this @ CAPS5 , @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 . @ CAPS3 get @ CAPS2 from the sun , and without going outside , @ CAPS3 do not get @ CAPS2 . not traveling outdoors deprives our body @ ORGANIZATION1 an important @ CAPS5 . @ CAPS2 affects more than just our health , as we will @ CAPS7 inside on the computer keeps us from having expenence real experience . @ CAPS3 learn things on the computer , but only virtually . What happens when @ CAPS3 are forced out into the real world and can not really do anything ? Everyone loves having friends and family , so @ CAPS2 does not make sense why @ CAPS3 would rather email them with trivial things instead @ ORGANIZATION1 talking . Instant messaging does not really bond people , as conversations are planned out you have time to think , so the person does not know what the real you would say . This frays the bonds between people , and once @ CAPS3 can not work together , even with family , @ ORGANIZATION1 can not work together at all , and nobody wants that . Computers take away too much to be spending so much time on . Blatantly , they are bad for people . Not only do they effectively cause abesity , they fool us into thinking @ CAPS3 can do things that really , @ CAPS3 can only do virtually , and make close people come apart . @ CAPS2 ' s ruining @ LOCATION1 .

9550,1092,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 , Are you always telling your kids to do their homework and get off the computer ? we will , I might just be able to help . Computers do not benefit our society today . People are spending to much time on them ; not enjoying the outdoors , and are taking away time to spend with friends and family . I believe having a limit each day on your computer might help solve these problems . The computers can be very distracting and you can use them too offten . Stairing at the computer screen can damage your eyes and kill brain cells . that is one thing kids and adults do not notice . You need your brain cells for school . Joins and other activities , computers can also distract you from completing work , and then you have to stay up late to finish homework should come before the computer . Time flys by as your clicking and typing . The next thing you know as it is ten o ' clock and your work is not completed . Since my schedule is so busy after school . I try to complete my work , then go to the computer before dance . This way I am my friends and relax . Taking time away from the computer is a smart idea . As it comes to @ DATE1 time the weather is going to be beautiful and you do not want to waste a pretty day on the computer , @ CAPS5 human body needs oxygen . Clearly , computers do not supply that . A great way to recieve oxygen is going outside for some exersize and energy . Playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer . You can swim , jump , or play sports . My doctor once told me , "" Everyone should have atleast an hour of exersize a day . "" You can not accomplish that by sitting at your computer . Next time there is sunshine out , no matter what season it is , go outside and take a break from electronics . Spending time with family and friends is a fun way to stay off the computer . Friends and Family are not people to take advantage of . They are people who are there for you when you are down and make you laugh . When your relatives come to town that you havn ' t seen in a while , You do not want to spend it on the computer . Talking and catching up with one another is a great way to re - connect . During family holidays , we do not bring our computers . We shut them off to spend time with each other . Friends and family are special gifts . So , do not throw away friendships or relationships with your family . Get away from the computer and bond .

9553,1499,1,"Dear @ PERSON2 , @ CAPS1 your latest article on the goods and bads of computers in our society was informative , I believe you left out a few major reasons why technology is doing more harm than good . If people do not become aware of the consiquences , who knows where our world is heading ? First off , I ' d like to mention the health issues associated with technology in general , but especally computers . Dr . @ PERSON1 of @ ORGANIZATION2 states that "" @ CAPS2 since the popularity of the internet boomed with the invention of websites like ' @ CAPS3 ' and ' @ CAPS4 ' , we have seen a drastic spike in obesity - related heart disease and diabetes . "" And @ PERSON3 is not exaggerating . Because of the sudden boom in electronics , more and more people prefer sitting on the couch with their brand new laptop or @ CAPS5 then go for a bikeride or play a game of fastball with friends . Because of this , more and more people become victims of heart attacks , strokes , cancer , and bone elipses that could leave them paralized for the rest of their life . Is playing that online game so important , to you that it is worth your life ? Next , I ' d like to touch on the fact that @ CAPS1 the internet @ MONTH1 seem like a great place to do some socializing , it can actually aid in losing friends insted of making them . I know what your thinking , @ PERSON2 , ' But sites like ' @ CAPS6 ' help people connect , why would they lose friends ? ' @ CAPS7 , really . Since it is so easy to type in a conversation , people are losing actual social skills . They also spend too much time talking to friends without meeting face - to - face , and that eventually causes them to drift apart . And when talking to someone over a screen , it is so hard to know if your actually close friends . Because of this , they can not bond and they will not have a real friendship . @ PERSON4 , a @ NUM1 year old at @ ORGANIZATION1 , says that him and his best friend now only talk over @ CAPS3 , and they do not even feel like true friends anymore . So finally , I have a request . Next time you turn on that laptop , think . Is this really worth losing your friends and even your health @ CAPS2 ?

9554,550,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , Computers are harmfully effecting the children , and they are going to effect @ CAPS1 generations even more . Computers are fine in moderation , as are most things . If they are needed for a school project that fine but using the computer everyday rather than exercising is not okay . Supporters of technology say that computers have a positive effect . I have to disagree . They say they practice hand eye coordination , they can teach you about far away places and you can talk with people online . Sports are a great way to exercise and practice hand eye coordination . Tennis , baseball , basketball , hockey , etc are all great sports that practice hand eye coordination . They are much healthier that I . Ming your friends all day .

Plus websites are filled with viruses , and what happens when your computer is dead due to viruses and you actually need your computer for a school project ? The simple alternative would be going to the local library and checking out a variety of books . The books are trusted and filled with information . The internet is also not a very safe place . Facebook , aim , email , twitter , etc are all ways for people to comunicate through the computer . Facebook , aim and twitter are scary and not safe because you @ MONTH1 not know who you are talking to . They do have a profile which you @ MONTH1 be able to relate to , but they could be lying . "" The internet is a broad place open to strangers , "" my dad says . I am not allowed to have these ways to comunicate because of the specific reasons that I stated earlier . My parents are doing this to protect me and I agree with their decision . Rather than talking to complete strangers go over to your friends house . Your friends are the people that you want to talk to and spend time with . Overall computers are bizarre pieces of technology that can be unsafe , not truthful , and are forcing children to become more dependent on adults . I have to disagree with the supporters of technology . There are many healthy alternatives to the computer . I believe that experts who are concerned that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time exercising , enjoying nature , and interacting with family and friends . Not only do the alternatives that I stated before keep people safe , they also practice a healthier way of living .

9555,479,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , Some people are debating whether advances in technology , such as computers , are benefitial to our daily life . I think that computers are a good addition to life for a few reasons . For one , information and knowledge are at your fingertips . It takes merely seconds to know anything you want or need to . Email , @ CAPS2 , @ CAPS1 , etc . can be labeled as wasteful or dangerous . New friends can be made everyday . Lastly , there can be limits set so no more worrying about to much time spent on the computers . One of the reasons computers can be benefitial to our daily life is what it can give us . Knowledge is just seconds away . Anything you might be interested in learning is all on the web . Homework , school projects , and even work need information that is not found anywhere else . The library is a great place to find what you are looking for , but if you are in a hurry and need what you are looking for quick , there is the online encyclopedia , world book , etc . Technology is becoming a huge part of our life today , many opinions are up in the air about it . If , there ' s one thing everyone can agree on , it is fast and can make daily tasks easier . Ordering clothes , books , movies , tickets for trips and more all can be done online . that is not all the computer has to offer . Friends / family are a necessary part of life , but they are not always living right around the corner . They @ MONTH1 live on the other side of the state , country , even world ! @ CAPS2 , @ CAPS1 , email , etc . can allow you to connect with anybody around the world at anytime . E - mail has been around longer than other websites like @ CAPS2 and myspce which allow you to keep daily tabs on them . @ CAPS1 or ichat allows you to instantely talk to anybody that you want . These websites can not replace being together in person , but it can help keep in touch for the meanwhile . Some are worried about spending too much time face to face with the screen , there is even something to prevent that . Time spent inside on the computer is becoming a problem . Not enough exersise or time spent outside can be unhealthy . Time limits can fix this problem . A certain amount of time can be plugged in . When there ' s @ NUM1 minutes left , it gives you a warning . That way more time can be spent outside in the open , and less inside staring at the screen all day . Many different opinions about whether computers belong in our life have been shared . I believe they are a beneficial part of our life .

9556,1156,1,"To the editor of the daily newspaper , I strongly believe that computers have a negative affect on people of all ages . Computers these days are being used way too much for useage of priveleges that we already have . While people are using the computer for random activities , they are not having any physical activity . Also emailing and facebooks are great websites to communicate with but people are checking emails all the time instead paying attention to when their parents get home from a long day at work . With this people are so consumed into the computer that kids get side tracked and forget to do homeworks . Computers are great invention but with todays society there are to many issues that are not always being appointed . In the first place , people are not getting the exercise that they need because they are playing on the computer or video chatting with a friend . About @ NUM1 of america is obess so excercising should definitely be a priority but with these new websites and activities on the computer people are getting held back . With this , kids and adults are communicating in high end ways that waste too much time . The computers have so many stupid activities that are not needed which make us not excercise because many people think that the options and webpages are important and needed . Indeed computers are a technology that is needed but people are taking advantage of it too much by having their whole life in the computer instead of having it toward other things such as excercising and being healthy . In addition to computers taking away from excerscising they are also taking time away from your family . For example , @ TIME1 when my dad got home . From a long day at work no @ CAPS1 truly a bear hug that he was longing for because everyone was so interested in their email or what my sisters friend just said on facebook . Family is the most important part of your life and if computers are getting in the way , computer use absolutely has to be changed . Which is more important to you , family or computers ? I understand that you still talk to your family and give them hugs but when you rae talking to your sister through facebook eventhough there just in the next room . It is lobvious needs to be done . Computers affect you and everyone around you in more ways than @ CAPS1 . Finally , computers take away family but also schoolwork and works . Most kids spend so much time on the computer and they to do their homework . This is unexeptable and can be away , kids and teenagers are always playing games , facebooking friends and video chatting making them realize at that they need to start their home work ! A girl from @ PERSON1 said , "" @ CAPS1 time I was on facebook for the whole afternoon and then I realized I never started my @ CAPS2 essay ! "" This has happened to so many people because computers are too distracting and drain your brain . Moreover , yesterday I remember that I was video chatting my friend for @ NUM2 hours and did not start my homework until @ NUM3 ! The computer evryone that goes it which is uneceptable . Without computers a negative affect people . off people exercising out with time in the computer which is unbelievable and terrible .

Using computers teaches hand - eye coordination , gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people , and lets people talk online with other people . I think that these are all very important . Why would not you want to have strong hand - eye coordination ? I think this a very important skill . Computers help teach hand - eye coordination and they keep it strong . While you are looking at the screen your hand is moving the mouse where you want it to go . Good hand - eye coordination is used for a lot of things ; mostly everything . If you play some sports like baseball , hand - eye is one of the most important elements .

Computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions . No one wants to be ignorant right ? People want to know what is going on in the world quick and easy . The computer does this . I remember when I was about @ NUM2 , our phone broke in our house . We could not go out and get one right away either . The only way we were able to communicate with our family and friends was by computer . The computer made it easier to e - mail everyone and tell them why we weren ' t answering our house phone . This happens more often than you think . People need to communicate through computer a lot . At work , if you need to talk to an employee or co - worker and you can not leave your desk , you can just e - mail the information to them . @ NUM4 out of @ NUM2 employees say that it is much faster and easier to e - mail information as opposed to talking them on the phone or in person . A lot of people agree that computer make life a lot easier . Computers teach hand - eye coordination and they let you communicate with other people .

Computers are good for if you need to find information about anything . All you need to do is type in what you want , and within seconds you have hundreds of different links for your desire . For example if you are in @ CAPS1 school and you are deciding what college that you should go try the a great place that you can go to get information . People all over the world do that just about everyday . It is also a great place if you need information if you are doing a project in school and you need more info on your subject @ CAPS2 I say it make things a lot easier there is no better example a reservation for a hotel or buying a plane ticket . Both of those things do on a computer because otherwise odds are you with of then . If we did not have computers you would need to go to the hotel and get a room , and if there were no room you out of luck . On a computer it will say if they have any or not you would need to @ CAPS3 tickets would have the exact same thing . Computer say @ CAPS2 there are available flights to your destination and how much . So @ CAPS2 you go to the airport you are not surprised . Another good reason why computer are good for people is that it helps your interact with your friends and family @ CAPS2 you can not see them . There so many different ways you can do it to . On @ CAPS4 , @ CAPS5 , myspace . All the websites like that help you stay in touch with all of your friends . Even now they have somethings where you can actually see the person you are talking to over the computer . So if you have no chance of seeing each other anytime soon you can talk to them then . I even do that with my brother , he is in college and I do not see him that much so I just start chatting with him on the computer . Now those are some reasons on why I feel that computers are a great part of our lives . Thing like finding information and booking hotels , airplanes , ect . All help make our lives a lot easier at times . And talking with other people just makes us happy . Now I hope you see why computers are a good part of all of our lives .",10.0,198,4.663186994492238,16.93103448275862,29,0.4024390243902439,5.0,1.5,1.284777238479929,0.01016260162601626,29.0

Yes , I think that computars have a negitive affect on people based on the following reasons .

Not me . I think that computers detach people from reality , create false personas , and has no physical benefit . This is what i think the computers effects have on people . First of all , Computers detach people from reality . it is a lot easier for someone to sit on the computer , browsing aimlessly on some social networking website , than go out and actually meet new people . Sure you @ CAPS2 send all the friend requests you want , but theres nothing that compares to a first impression that you get from meeting someone in person . The computer can also have an affect on family members and the time spent with them . Secondly , the computer creates false personas . If i had a facebook or @ CAPS3 account , it would be very easy to say something false about myself , or someone else . The computer dosn ' t know better . This allows people to gain , "" friendships "" with others that do not know the real you . I find this as a real problem because eventually lead to shaky or unsteady relationshops . Lastly , I think that the computer offers no physical gain , This nation is in a severe heath crisis . With things easier to get now a days like fast food , and drugs , I do not think that computers help . People need discipline and theres a time and place for everything , including computers . However those that are not disciplined might use them more than they need to and that is not good . So @ CAPS2 you imagine a world controlled by computers ? I think that little by little , that is what is happening , slowly taking away the human element . I think the effects will be severe , detaching reality , creating false personas , and offering no physical gain .

That is that great thing about technology . You can talk to friends or family get help , and it is there . Whenever you need it . Have you ever had to move so far away from your best friend that you cried so much someone thought it was raining ? we will this is not nessesary because you can now have a webcam in your computer and talk as much as possible . Of course , it is out the same as being there with the person , but it is pretty close . You can talk whenever , wherever , with the great invention of computers . One other way that a computer benifits talking in other people @ MONTH1 be you and your friends can chat . If your parents are out and will not let you get out you can still talk to your friends . Lastly if you are older you can use facebook to find friends you have not seen in a long amount at time . Another reason that the computer and technology are great is because you can get information you need it . Schools practicaly live on computers . Not only the students but teachers too . The teachers assign projects that include going on the computers and finding information all about your topic . Also if you just that you have never heard of before you can go and find out about it . It is great to those all you have to @ CAPS2 is clik a buttom and every bit of information is at you fingertips . This can coms in handy when you are in a fight with your friend about who is a better @ PERSON1 . You can just look up who has gotten more home runs and there you go . you have got a winner ! Have you ever been at dinner and someone ask if you have the hockey game score and you friends , husband brothers out his phone and then says @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 about @ NUM3 minutes after you asked ? we will that must mean they have internet on their phone . Phones such as blackberrys , @ CAPS3 , and iPhone all have internet built in . This means when they are in the airport waiting for their plane , they can just play a game or watch some television . To me that is a pretty cool invention . Also people in business and industry have phones with internet built in because they can just look something up at anytime . So this is why I think having technology is good in our society . Ecspecially because they can talk to far away friends and whatever . Kind of information you need you can already have it with a touch of a button .

Most importantly , people who spend too much time on the computer do not see their family and friends . These are the reasons why people should not spend so much of their time on a computer . Since people spend too much time on the computer , the exercise less and less . A recent poll shwos that @ NUM2 in every @ NUM3 @ CAPS5 is overweight . If our modern society did not have so many distractions like computers than maybe people would be bore & maybe fo outside . Back in @ DATE5 only @ PERCENT2 of the @ CAPS6 population was obese .

The kids would rather sit inside a airconditioned hoose thatn go outside & have some good healthy fun & work up a sweat . Computers keep people from exercising so their affect on people is negative .

Friendships are easily ruined and usually the cause of this is some kind of misunderstanding . It is very sad but true that kids would rather watch goofy vidoes than visit a grandparent .

Not to mentio , we even find activities to do in the cold , freezing winter such as sledding nad snowboarding . @ CAPS2 need tog et out and chair , pry their eyes from the computer screen and go out and smell the fresh air . The feeling of being outside will raise your spirits and sgift you from a person in a trance to a person that feels alive !

This vcreates and unhealthy family , which is bad because people need to have a strong connection with family . Studies show that the average time a person spends on the computer is five hours !

With computers a business in @ LOCATION2 or somewhere else in @ LOCATION4 can be connected with a building in @ LOCATION1 . They can have live video chats together . With the help of the computers they are able to contact any branch of their business all over the world . Even smaller businesses use the computer to connect to customers . Now a days we do a lot of online shopping . This is an example of how stores connect to their customers . Stores can show buyers everything they have to offer including store locations . This can help stores get more business by connecting the buyer to the shop . The computer not only connects stores and businesses but also people to people . @ PERCENT1 of kids in my school own a computer . With all these computers many social networking sites are born .

If we did not have the computers to let us know about the earthquake in @ LOCATION3 they would be in alot more trouble . They would not have all of these donations .

For example , a study at @ ORGANIZATION1 showed that families with more computers in their houses communicated less . The children are talking to their friends online or are going on social networking sites instead of talking in person to their family members . Also , computers are making it very hard for families to have meals together . When the children are on the computer , they do not want to leave .

The electricity that runs computers of this radiation . Being exposed to this could lead to brain damage or possible death . When my aunt bought a computer for the first time , she complained about massive headaches that kept returning . This was caused by the radiation emitted from the computer . Another health risk is obesity . When children sit in front of a computer for many hours , they have an increase in apetite . These children eat because they have nothing better to do . While on the computer , the users eat and will gain weight because of the loss of exercise . They could become obese and possibly get diabetes . Therefore , there is less communication in families , a loss of excersise , and health concerns caused by the computers .

Computers make people get less exercise , they kill brain cells , and they can ruin your lifestyle . You @ MONTH1 believe computers have impared your life , but consequences remain . Many @ CAPS2 today are obese and lazy . They do not get any exercise . There are many reasons for this , but one big reason is because they sit in front of computers all day !

When you sit in front of a computer , your eyes are on the screen . Now , scientists from the @ ORGANIZATION1 foundation have found they staring at the screen kills brain cells .

Try opening a book ! They are cheaper , more accurate , and do not kill your cells ! do not stare at the computer screen , because your slowly destroying your body , and knowledge can be gained elsewhere . For a final point , I would like to say that computers simply destroy your lifestyle . Virtual people are not your real friends and family . Computers cause you to turn away from them . Online interaction is not like just talking to someone in person or on the phone . You can lose your real friends . Plus , computers run your lifestyle because half the things you think you are learning are not real . You can not trust certain sites or certain people . Being with ones you know and love is much more beneficial , because computers drag you in you are taken away from the real world . I feel that we should all take a stand against computers .

Social networking websites , like facebook , games websites like @ CAPS3 , and also websites like @ CAPS4 can be very tempting and distracting when you should be doing homework . Procrasination is very easy to give into . But self control is the only way to avoid this problem . Budgeting your time so that you can do both your homework , and go on the computer is also very important . One thing that I find very useful on computers is an online textbook . We are lucky enough today that most large books can be formated onto a computer . Instead of carrying a @ NUM1 - pound text book , you can just use a @ NUM1 megabyte book on the internet . This makes travel to and from school much easier . That , and textbooks often use up a lot of desk space , but all you nneed is the space that a computer will consume anyway . Studying is also made easier this way . All of the things that a computer can do are great . But this can also keep us from going outside , excersising , and seing real people in real life . This need for the computer can be bad . We are too connected as a society . Our status , feelings , friends , and position in life are always needing to be updated . Distractions are everywhere . Facebook , for instance , is very addicting . You are looking at a virtual landsacape . Self control really is the only way to get off the computer and step into the real world . Overall , computers are great , but you have to know when , and how long to use it . It has several benefits such as entertainment , communication , and information . But all of these things can be just as distracting as they can be helpful . Knowing this . I hope that society can think of the pros and cons of the computer .",10.0,219,4.954831529145761,12.611111111111109,36,0.4813186813186813,6.0,1.6483516483516485,1.6769081691685783,0.030769230769230767,36.0
9577,215,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION2 , I am expressing my concern to you about the side effect new technologies , such as computers have an humans . Computers impact humans in a harmful manner because people are spending too much @ ORGANIZATION1 their quality time on their computers which additionally leads to less time spent doing exercise . People also do not get to spend as much as their days outdoors and interacting with friends and family . Firstly , people are spending too much @ ORGANIZATION1 their time surfing the net .

Dr . @ DR1 from the @ CAPS1 technology society , says ' that if this increases @ ORGANIZATION1 time spent on the internet , continues for more years , most @ CAPS3 will completly lose contact with family and friends outside @ ORGANIZATION1 the social computer network . The average weight @ ORGANIZATION1 a @ NUM2 year old has increased from @ NUM3 pounds in @ DATE1 , to @ NUM4 pounds today . Statistics show that the main caus for this dramatic increase in weight is due to the acessive amount @ ORGANIZATION1 time spent on computers in addition @ CAPS4 do not have as much time to exercise . Teenagers need to exercise three times a week for thirty minutes each . @ CAPS5 the average adolescent only spend ten minutes a week exercising not including gym . All @ ORGANIZATION1 these numbers must change and a way to start would be losing the computer because people are spending too much time on them and less time exercising . Secondly , comuters are effecting the people get to go outside and enjoy nature . Form my personal experience nature is a beautiful thing to be apart @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS5 now adays I spend way too much time on social networks such as facebook , my space and @ CAPS6 others . How often do you go outside to take a walk , fo for a bike ride or something else ? A study done by @ PERSON2 shows that the average person living in @ LOCATION1 have only spent a total @ ORGANIZATION1 @ NUM5 days outside in the past two years after reciving their new computer . This must change people need to enjoy what this world has to offer . Thirdly , computers have effected the interaction between family and friends .

I love to sit down and talk with my mom over a steaming cup @ ORGANIZATION1 hot chocolate . @ PERCENT1 @ ORGANIZATION1 people now a days do not spend anytime with family and @ PERCENT2 @ ORGANIZATION1 people use computers to interact with friends . It is vitally important that people stop using computers because "" before you know it you will have lost all communication with family and friends "" says @ PERSON1 from I . U .

In conclusion , I urge you to make the right desion by quitting using computers and in return will be a much happier and stronger individual . Computers impact humans in a terrible way because people spend too much time on them leading to a lack in exercise , time spent outside and in addition interaction between friends and family .

9583,722,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 in @ CAPS2 , Computers are one of the world ' s best discoveries today . For one , they help in our educational processes . They also help connect people from all over the world in little time and are a neccesity in science research . Overall , computers are the best thing that has ever happened to mankind . First and foremost our children today are already struggling in their educational systems . But with new computers they strive to meet every goal . Teachers cannot tell them everything but computers can , underneath that hard drive is a wealth of knowledge awaiting to be saked up by eager minds . Also , in todays world , waiting is almost non - existant . Learning to type gives these children better opportunities for success in later life . Family , say your child is out @ NUM1 school day . Normally , they would miss their homework . But now , they can check it online and get back to their crucial studies when they are feeling better unless you want to risk tommorow ' s future workforce , computers are in essential tool for us , and our children . One of the best things a lot this world is that we ' re all different , connecting with each other helps us learn how to tell with each other and move forward as a society . Conneticing through the internet through programs like @ ORGANIZATION1 is important for buissnesses as it helps them make decisions faster will ultimatly effect us . But do not be fooled . It can also befor pleasure , say @ CAPS3 ' son & buissness trip in @ LOCATION1 . No problem . Just go on webcam with him and you do not have to miss him anymore . In the government , problems evolve quickly , and steathily . To solve this , a president can quickly connect to his / her advisors while still being in his / her office . Connecting people through computers is maraculous , and important to life as we know it . In addition , we would not be were we are in science if it was not for computers . First of all , we are making great strides with cancer research to day , than estatic common computer . If it was not for that , we might not even have kemotherapy . Lets face it , computers are faster then us ; way faster . But this is a god thing , because faster proccesing means faster research . While a simple machine @ MONTH1 not tell us the cure through it is proccesing speed . It certainly brings us a lot closer to unraveling the mysteries certain diseases shold beneath . Two minds are better than one . Even a scientist can not know everything . But while connecting through a computer to scientists all over the world , they can analize research , and make very informed , responsible decisions . Certainly that will extend our life exsentency , and who does not want you have larger ' s some people say that people are too glued to their computer screens . But bear in mind , these are the people helping you stay alive , and helping lower your heathcare bill yoour talking about . So when you get I will and they find a cure , why do not you still compain that they only found it because they were attached to their keyboards and monitors ! Trust them , they know what they are doing . So can we come to an agreement life ? Computers only do good things , like enhance our youth ' s advention , connect our and help us find cures for the most malignant diseases and illnesses in the world . So help the world help you , and go promote the use of computers across your community .

9586,166,1,"To editor , @ CAPS1 ' s a beautiful day . The sun is shining , the birds are chirping , and a lazy breeze is flowing through the trees . But you do not notice any of @ CAPS1 because you are plopped down in front of your comuter tapping away on @ CAPS2 or email . With modern technology . This is a common scenario . Experts are concerned that excessive computer use can harm your health , hamper your social skills , and cause you to be disconnected from nature . While computers are helpful in our lives too much of one thing is never a good thing . As mentioned , camputers have can a negative effect on your health . Computers cause people to be lazy . They would rather @ CAPS2 and email than go outside and excersize in the cool , crisp , fresh air . In fact , statistics recently released by the @ ORGANIZATION1 show that computers are the @ NUM1 leading reason for obesity . And weight problems are not the only thing computer to worry about . Too much time in front of the computer will also take @ CAPS1 ' s toll on your eyes . Even local doctors have pointed @ CAPS1 . "" @ CAPS4 since computers have become a common household item , the number of i have eye has gone up about @ NUM2 or @ NUM3 more kids every year than the year says @ ORGANIZATION3 of the @ ORGANIZATION2 . And if that is not enough , typing too many this @ CAPS5 and emails day after day can give you repetetive syndrome , also known as carpal tunnel . Carpal tunnel used to be more when typewriters were big , but dwindled down once computers with newer , easier to type on keyboards came around . But excessive daily use of computers is causing doctors to see more cases of carpal tunnel crop up . @ CAPS1 is clear that if you want to stay healthy , computer usage should be limited . Secondly , too much time spent on the computer affect your ability to communicate with others . Computers are helpful when you need to talk to someone but people have gott on so used in @ CAPS1 that they sometimes find @ CAPS1 awkward to talk to someone face to face . Their eyes look everywhere except for the person , they shift their weight back and forth and struggle to find the right words to say things that should be easy . This awkwardness can also ruin previously close friendships . Friends will talk to each other endlessly through @ CAPS2 , but have no words for each other when they meet face to face . I remember @ DATE1 , i did not see one of my friends at all ; we just @ CAPS8 each other daily . When we saw each other at school , we found @ CAPS1 hard to carry a conversation and @ CAPS1 took some getting used to talking face to face again . And this is not the only way friendships are ut on the line by computers . Personal and meaningful conversations @ MONTH1 sometimes be . you are on the phone with your friend and you are telling her about something important that you need advice on . A few seconds after you begin talking you are interrupted by a loud @ CAPS7 ! followed by a "" hold on , so and so just @ CAPS8 me .

I agree that computers are having a positive impact on us . Advances in technology are helping us become more efficiant . Computers also give us the ability to research places and things we @ MONTH1 never get the opportunity to see in person . We are also able to talk online with other people who we might have not met otherwise . The most important , though , is our advances in technology . Recently on the news I saw a segment of how at @ ORGANIZATION2 they are using robots to make surgery more efficient . This also means that there are smaller incisions being made , so that means a faster recovery . Another part of society that has been advancing is crime solving . Before there were computers , there was no blood testing , no fingerprinting , and most likely no x - rays . Computers made these things much easier for people to accomplish .

They also give us the ability to search topics we want to know more about or a faraway place we have never been to .

Did you ever miss the newest episode of your favorite show ? we will , all these things and more can be solved by using the computer . The computer gives us all the things we need . Whether that is information , games , or online friend chatting websites . The computer is necessary for our society today . Countless times I was in desperate need for information . If I am doing a school report on animals . I can just go on the computer and search whatever I want . There ' s no more need for driving to the town library and then searching through countless books and encyclopedias . I just think that that is a waste of time , when you basically have everything you need twenty foot away . And it is in your house ! There is no more need to search for hours through biographies . If you need to know state capitals , you can find it in no time . To me , that is a life saver . Not only can computers help you with information , it can make school projects so much easier . In my own experiences , I had needed pictures on school projects . Instead of drawing it , the internet can save time and effort . All you need to do is print out the pictures ! However , if you have an essay that is , let ' s say , supposed to be ten pages who wants to write all that ? With a computer , you can type it out in half the time . Then , when done , you can print it , or even send it straight to your teacher . But , if it is not finished , you can save it on a thumbdrive , and use it on any computer you want . All in all , that is a huge help . My final reason why computers are good , is that they serve instant pleasure . Computers have millions of games that a kid can play for free . Also , it has many website , like @ CAPS1 , or @ CAPS2 , that let you interact with friends . If you need to tell them something , there is no need for a phone . Plus , if you miss certain shows , or want to watch music videos , there are websites for that . As a kid , I am usually never home because of sports and school activites . If I miss something on @ LOCATION1 , it is almost definitely going to be on the computer . You do not have to wait a week or so before they replay that episode . Who wants to do that ?

9592,918,1,"To who this @ MONTH1 concern , In my opinion , computers have greatly improved our lives . Therefore I believe that owning and using a computer is for the greater good . Three reasons that support my decision are that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily , they allow us to connect with people in far away places , and they help us to learn more about life and the planet we live on . Please consider my reasons when making your decision . My first reason is that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily . This in turn allows us to get more done . For example lets say that your doing a report on @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 . You could run out to the library and look through hundreds of books and newspapers or you could just sit down at your at your computer , open up a web browser , and type a "" @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 "" into the search box . Within a few seconds you will have searched hundreds more libraries newspapers and even other computers to find information on your topic . You can also look for information on videos . Old newscasts , inteveiws , documeteries , you name it . it is all there right at your fingertips . My second reason is that it allows people in far away places to connect . If I said that to my mom she would probably tell me to go use the phone , but computers can do everyhing a phone can do and more . You ca share photos , videos , games , just about anything . Recently , I joined facebook and I now can talk to people I have not seen in years who moved away I was born . Over the @ DATE1 I had gone to my @ CAPS3 . My dad introduced me to his uncle who shared the same name as me . Then about month ' s later I got a friend request from a @ CAPS4 who up in @ LOCATION1 , @ LOCATION4 , which is far from where I live , and now lives in . After talking to him for a while I learned that he was , the son of mydaduncle . If it weren ' t for my computer I would have never met him . Also , I recently learned and am getting pretty good . So one day my friends look me through a which has all it , We began video taping a posting . So the computer has also allowed us to what without them having to be there . My third and final reason is that the computer allows us learn how to improve our lives and the planet we live on . Many people say that if you on the computer all the time you will become fat and lazy , but that is not always the case . I have actually been able to improve my exercise rutine byuseing the computer . Whenever I go out for a run , I can come home and find out exactly how far I ran , how many calories I burned , and anything else I want to know . I have also been able to find new more effective excersizes that allow me to target different muscles . Now lets talk about what we can learn about our planet . We can use a computer to find weather patters which allows us to plan our days accordingly . We can also use it to learn about news happening around the world . For example , the day of the earthquake in @ LOCATION2 , I opened up in my homepage and there it was and I was able to learn about what had happened . Finally a computer allows us to learn different cultures around the world . We can learn about how ancient egiptions lived , how the people in @ LOCATION3 or @ CAPS5 make money or how they construct their houses . All the things we would never know if we did not have a computer . In conclusion , computers have improved the lives of the human race by a great deal . They have allowed us and how to improve our lives .

As you can see , I agree that computers are a bad idea . I bet some people have never thought of this but computers can lead kids , and maybe even adults , to cheating . There are websites on the internet where the user just types the question in , and they get an answer . There is @ CAPS4 another way of cheating , copying others work , essays or articles form a website . Some students could be told to write a biography on a person , and they could just copy an article , switch some words around to make a sound like their own paper , and with no guilt .

Because this show I realized that computers kinds anti - social divorce between parents go up . Do you see all people computers looking up facts about things as going on the computers learning . I know that when I have time to go on the computer , I am not looking up things to learn . Most people these days do not care too much about learning about countries , other than their own , or people , other than people they know .

First of all why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that people could contack with friends and families from far - away places . An example to support my reason is that people from all parts of the world have families different places . And they cannot have a good contack with them . But if they go on the internet they could their friends and families and chat with them . This shows that if you live in the @ LOCATION2 and you have a friends that live in @ LOCATION1 you could have a with I have families that lives and @ LOCATION1 and it is hard to them . But when I am on the computer I can chat with them and have a fun time . This shows that you need a computer to catch up with friends and family . that is why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people . Second of all why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that computers helps you learn more about different parts of the world . An example is that if you do not know anything about a country or a place you could go on the internet a research and learn more about that place . This shows that computers is important to have . Another example is that when I have a project or a essay and I do not know about it . I could go on the computer and look it up . And by doing this it will help me on my project or essay . that is why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people . Finally why I believe so is that computers helps you understand and learn more about life . An example is that if you do not know if something is right or wrong you could look it up and it @ MONTH1 help you . This shows that computers can give advices . Another example is that computers could give you an idea on what to do . If you are trying a new resipie and you are not sure on @ CAPS3 to make it .

Computers have caused problems where kids do not do any types of physical activity which deprives them of their daily needed exercise . Also , children spend so much time on the computer , they do not get a chance to enjoy the outdoors . Another effect computers have on kids is that @ CAPS6 stops them from spending time with family and friends . I do not know how people can sit on a computer all day without moving around . First , kids do not get enough exercise because the spend too much time on a computer . We know almost everybody has a computer even I do , but @ CAPS6 does not mean @ CAPS6 has to be used @ NUM1 . I am a athlete and I enjoy being on the computer , but I do not use @ CAPS6 every second I can . Doctors always reccomend everyone to get a least an hour of exercise everyday . Most people do not do that . They would be the kind of people who uses the computer or a different electronic a lot . That is also causing childhood obesity . If all you do is sit on the computer all day , your going to be someday . But people need to get off the computer and do something like a sport or even a game like . If you do not exercise you will not enjoy the outdoors . Second , people are not enjoying the outdoor . If somebody likes to play sports they should not do not on @ CAPS4 for three hours instead they invite a couple of friends to lay same basketball . Even walking home from school with a friend is a good way to be outside . People @ MONTH1 think during the winter there is nothing to do . Have a snowhall fight with some friends and enjoy your selves . Nobody should feel embarrassed even if you wanted to play tag with a friend but you are @ NUM2 . Just get outside and do something . There are millions of things to do that is not going on a computer . you are a kid so long that you have to enjoy your selves now before your serious with you life . Lastly when you are not outside you are not enjoying yourself with your friends or family . People are spending too much time on the computer and less with friends or family . you are not hanging out with you friend if you are chatting on @ CAPS4 . Is @ CAPS6 so hard to tell them online "" @ CAPS5 @ NUM3 come @ NUM3 my house . "" @ CAPS6 takes two seconds . Then in no time you will be hanging out with your friend . I do not understand why is @ CAPS6 some embarrassing to be with your family . Mydad and I like to go and play basketball or ping pong with each other . We do not care becaue we have fun .

9597,1149,1,"Dear Newspaper , Advances in technology , while amazing , do not always have a positive effect on society . That is why , I honestly believe computers do not benefit my community . For instance , computers can be very dangerous and people these days just seem to spend too much time using them ! Not to mention , computers cost way too much money . To begin , my mom and dad always say , "" do not talk to strangers , "" when I go out . I think they should say the same when I go to use my computer . Computers can truly be dangerous for someone who is not careful . For example , online predators often depict themselves as someone they are not . Therefore , you can not ever really trust someone you simply met in a chat room . Also , cyber bullying is another problem computers put people at risk for . Another danger computers have , is anything posted on the internet can be accessed by almost anyone . This includes pictures , blogs , comments and . I believe society would be better off without the constant worry of a computer ! Secondly , people , especially the younger generation , spend excessive amounts of time on computers . Some people spend hours each day using a computer when they could be doing an activity that actually benefited them . If people spent just as much time helping their community as much time helping their community as they did on the computer , the world would be a much better place to live . Not to mention , it would bring people closer to one another . Computers seem to control peoples ' lives and that just is not healthy . I think people should spend more time living and less time with their faces glued to a computer screen ! Lastly , computers are like vampires , sucking away your money . In @ DATE1 ' s economy people need to be saving their money for college or even simpler things like a new pair of shoes ! Additionaly , at the rate that technology is advances , even the most high - tech computers are out of date in a year or two and a new one is needed . Also , computers ' prices are constantly rising . It is very hard to keep up ! I strongly believe computers are a waste of money and bring society down .

The reason is because you can interact with friends and family that they know , the computer @ MONTH1 be portable so you can still get outside , and lastely people can research places where they want to go on vacation . These reasons are how computers have a good effect on humans . To begin with , seeing people in person is not the only way to communicate , on the computer there is many ways . There are chat rooms , that have typing to eachother . Take my friend @ PERSON5 for example , he used to live in @ LOCATION2 with all his friends and family until buisiness came along . His buisiness transfered @ PERSON5 all the way to @ LOCATION1 . Thank god he had a computer , because other wise he would not have able to communicate with his friends . @ PERSON5 is not the only person in which he is transfered far away from home . In fact , @ PERSON4 showed @ PERCENT1 of people with a computer tend to talk to friends and family more often because they can do it whenever they need . Gene a phsychyatrist states that when someone in a family has to leave to go on buisiness , then that family will start relying on a computer to communicate . Do you want to lose a friend or family member ? Moreover , computers @ MONTH1 be portable . If a computer is portable then you can see nature and still use the computer to get the job done . Take my cousin @ PERSON2 is a teacher and always has to do his students grades during the weekend . He was bummed out because he could never get outside . So for his birthday , he got a portable computer , this allowed him to go outside and do his job while getting fresh air and seeing nature . @ PERSON2 is one of many lucky people that has had this happen to them . @ PERSON6 has shown that @ PERCENT2 of teachers buy portable computers so they can see nature and get fresh - air while doing their job . @ PERSON1 , proved that if a teacher does not get any fresh air while doing their job then they can make a valuable mistake or even get sick . Would you , a teacher , want to get sick with no fresh air or be healthy working out doors ? Lastly , there is more to do on computers than doing work and communicating with friends and family . You can research places for vaction . My aunt @ PERSON3 had always dreamed of going on vacation but could not find any information on fun , outdoor places . Until , she got her hands on a computer . This way she found a fun place and left the country for week . @ PERSON3 is not the only person this has happened to .

I have also heard that people believe in the tecnology . So , the reason why I am writing today is about this issue is to put my beliefs out there . I believe that this new technology is effecting our daily exercising , playing outside to enjoy nature and interacting with friends and family . Now that are new technology with computers and such , people are distracted and do not want to exercise . This will effect our youth because we will be fat , unhealthy and sluggish all the time . @ PERSON1 we do not want this to happen to our youth because we are the future and if this keeps up the state and country will suffer . Another reason is that it is good to exercise and not be on the computer or watching @ CAPS2 all the time is because @ CAPS1 has been proven you have more energy and will feel happier most of the time . Computers do not do that for us at all . A poll even says that @ PERCENT1 of people get headaches and feel tired after being on the computer . Exercise will not do that at all . Sence all of our new technology with @ CAPS2 and other gagits people really do not go outside play around and enjoy nature anymore . I was asking my mother about this topic and she said , "" @ CAPS4 these days just do not go outside anymore . I remember when I was your age and my mother would kick me outside at @ NUM1 am and I would not be back home until around @ NUM2 pm . "" I believe that this should still happen . Maybe parents should still do this with their @ CAPS4 and have them run around the neigborhood with other @ CAPS4 . If we did this more offtine maybe @ CAPS4 and adults too . will just do this naturally and will not have to relie on computers or @ CAPS5 for entertainment . do not you think this is a good idea @ PERSON1 ? My last topic is with computers and cellphone and how we really do not interact with friends and family anymore . Now a days Friends aim , video chat or text each other instead of going and doing something with them . This is not really healthy for us because we might not know how to talk to people in real life . Also is someone aims or texts you , you really do not know how their tone is because you are not talking to them face to face . Lastly I know familys that get hurt by technology because that is all they do . They do not put down their get off their emails and they feel like they do not see each other . This is also not a health relationship with family members . @ PERSON1 I really hope I have persuade to you that technology is only ok to use sometime and not very day .

They also do not let us enjoy the beauty of nature and exercising . One out of every @ NUM1 teens spends more time telling people on the computer then face to face .

First is that @ CAPS3 is possible for you to get big @ PERSON1 fat , being fat is not a good thing @ CAPS3 could actually be heart breaking because they can not help @ CAPS3 , and i feel really bad for them . I have a few friends that are over weight like @ PERSON1 , @ PERSON1 is a very over weight kid , he was about @ NUM1 lbs whe nhe was @ NUM2 , I have not seen him in like a year and we had some good @ CAPS2 , but I do feel really bad because he is very over weight and @ CAPS3 is terrible , @ PERSON1 does not even know how to ride a bike , nobody would teach him anyways because he does not have a father and his mother is over weight as we will and as fat as his sister . see her anymore . So being over weight is bad and sitting and playing on the computer will make @ CAPS3 worse . Next is @ CAPS4 are way better things to do than sit around on the computer all day , messing around on the computer all day is like saying in just going to throw my life away . Instead of being on the computer you could be with friends whether @ CAPS3 is shopping sports you are still moving and that is way better then being on the computer trust me . Go for a walk @ PERSON1 some thing just try to get yourself dumb , but still fun , computer . I will @ CAPS3 ' s fun @ CAPS4 are many many thing to do on the computer . Most importantly is that @ CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air , being outside is a definatly amazing thing to do , you could be walking , be on trampoline , @ PERSON1 skateboarding anything is better then being on the computer , even just sitting @ CAPS4 on a rock outside is good for your body cause you need to got fresh air in your system . Just do something that involves being outside @ CAPS3 is so much fun . So all you computer lovers get off and have some fun being outside with friends @ PERSON1 your family . I hope you all listen to me and take my advice so remember @ CAPS3 is very possible to get fat , @ CAPS4 are way better things to do then sit around on the computer all day , and @ CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air .",10.0,181,3.589275993912838,33.93333333333333,15,0.3549019607843137,5.0,1.4235294117647062,0.9055872616982604,0.017647058823529408,15.0
9611,1669,1,"Dear Newspaper @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 has come to my attention that the aspect of computers and their influence on people has been brought up . I personally feel that computers are a marvelous tool to help mankind advance . They provide infinite knowledge , entertainment , and dispite what the opposing side says , allow social interactions for those who don ' @ CAPS4 like to meet face to face . My first reason why computers benefit humans rather than hurt them is the knowledge they provide . Computers give access to the internet , which has near - infinitr amounte of knowledge stored inside @ CAPS2 . With a simple click of a button you have thousands of websites dedicated to answering your question . They can provide tons of information normally unobtainable . Take for example two students , one with a conputer are without . Both are given an assignment to write a report on a famous person . The one with the computer logs any searches for the reason , and in seconds has enough information to write numerous reports . He aces the reports , and continues to use this method . He graduates top of the class , goes through college and gets a high paying job right out of the gate . The one without the computer needs to go to the library . After spending an hour walking there , he learns that all the books on thet person are checkedout . He finds a book with a short bit on that person and writes about thet . He fails the test , fails the grade , drops out of school , and works ot a @ ORGANIZATION1 his entire life . See how much of a different a computer can make ? My second reason is that , even though computers are often thought of as destroying @ CAPS2 , @ CAPS3 can build social lives . Millions of people use the internet everytime and there are places on the web built so that they can talk . Some people @ MONTH1 that this is and leads to , but anyone who has basic knowledge knows not to information . The internet also has and those still unsure can use specially sites to talk to people they know in life onlt . @ CAPS2 also allows for people to ask questions . Having differently finding specific information ? Just post a question on a public site use people with first hand experience will answer @ CAPS2 with all the detail you need and more . Say that somebody wants to be a writter , but needs to know how the writing system works , how to set a job in @ CAPS2 , what the pay is , etc . He searches the internet , but only finds job applications and college ady so he asks the questions on a public site . Someone who has been a write their whole lives checks out the question , and answers @ CAPS2 ion great detail . Problem solvely and @ CAPS2 someone on the internet . My final reason is the entertainment computer provide you can play games , watch movies or homemade videos , and even talk to friends . Computers allow you to access thousands of free services to benefit you . Sitting in your room , bored ? Why not play a game on your computer . Tired of @ CAPS4 . V movies ? Go to the computer and have an infinite wideo library ? Go to the computer and have an infinite video library at your dipasle . Lonely ? Go to a social website and strike up a conversation . @ CAPS2 has infinite entertainment , right at your finger - tips . In conclusion , I believe that compkuters is no limit to what you can do with a computer , as long as you have the imagination . Computers were invented to benefit mankind , not hurting and they are doing a great job .",10.0,288,5.175491026527374,14.51219512195122,41,0.4832214765100672,6.0,1.6291946308724832,1.6480342671697046,0.026845637583892617,41.0
9613,1440,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , it has come to my attention that more and more people use computer , but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society . I strongly believe that computers do benefit society for three reasons . First , computers are a great source to do school work on . Computers let you learn more information . In addition , computers are a great way to keep in touch with friends and family . Clearly you can see why computers have positive effects on people and society . My first reason why I believe computers benefit society is because computers are a great source to use do school work with . An example of this would be if a science teacher gave their class an assainnment to do that had to be typed . it is impossible to type an essay without a computer . Further more , if the project or assignment needs to have information looked up and their is no time in your day to go to a library , the computer is a great source . Now does not that make sense ? Computers do not just help you with homework , but many people go to college online also . My parents do not have enough money to afford me to go to college , "" says @ NUM1 - year old @ PERSON1 , "" so I take free course online and they work great ! "" @ CAPS1 it obvious that computers have a good effect on people ? In addition to schoolwork , computers are a great place to look when you need information . For example , you have just bought a new house and want to know more about that area . The computer is an great place to look at updated pictures , and learn about your new hometown . Sixty - nine percent of people use information from the computer to buy a home . People @ MONTH1 also want to learn basic information about bears or bees is my belief that the computer is a great source to do learn infromation obviously , computers have a great effect on people and it benefit society . Lastly , computers are helpful ways to keep in touch with family and friends . "" I have my whole mom ' s side of the family living in @ LOCATION1 . When I get to use the computer to keep in touch with them . I feel closer and part to keep in touch with them . i feel closer and part of one big happy family , "" @ PERSON2 of @ STATE1 , @ NUM2 , says . People who have family living in other states , countries and even other countries , do not get to see eachother every day of the year @ CAPS2 is why computers can help , the people keep in touch . Another example would be if your mom or dad went away for a few days , weeks or months and you wanted to talk to them of ten . A good way to do that would be using email or instant messaging . Therefore , i strongly believe that computers are great for people and do benefit the society . to sum it all up , computers benefits society and have possitive effects on people . Computers are great sources to do school work , they give you information your looking for , and are great ways to keep in touch with family and friends . Clearly you can see why I strongly believe that computers have a strong and possitive effect on people and benefit the society .

9616,734,1,"Dear newspaper , This year my school and a cop come into my school and tell me and my peers about the dangers of online . This has made me believe that computors are not beneficial . Computors are not beneficial because they enforce bad habits . Plus , websites and some applications are dangerous . Also , they are very addictive . Computors have a bad effect on people . To begin , computors enforce bad habits . For example , some websites are bad websites that say mean things about other people . Some kids @ MONTH1 join in on the cyber bulling because other kids are kids @ MONTH1 give in to peer pressure because they want to get accepted by their peers so badly . Furthermore , someone @ MONTH1 agree to meet someone they do not know . That can be scary because you do not know if this person is really someone you thought they were . Recently , I read a magazine and it had an article in it about people going to meet other people they online . Most people found at that it was not the person they thought they were . Finally , the computor enforces bad habits because people @ MONTH1 send someone some questionable pictures to someone else . As I mentioned before , when the police officer came to our school he talked about this . He said that people were sending pictures of them that were innapropiate to other people . Those other people would send it around and in the end it was a horrible mess . I am sure if computers did not have a giant effect on people , this would not be as big of a problem as it is . Computors do not only cause bad habits , but they are also dangerous . I am sure if you listen to the news you will hear stories about child predators . I think that is one huge problem . If computers did not have such a on people this would not be a problem . In addition , computors are dangerous because kids @ MONTH1 choose to make bad decisions because they do not knew . For example , many kids who are on myspace or facebook have not talked to their parent or guardian about internet safety . Or maybe even their parent or guardian is not monitering them to make sure they are safe online . In conclusion , the computer is dangerous because feelings could be hurt because of myspace , facebook , a blog , a video , or maybe even more . As an illustration , one time one the news I heard a story about a girl who was tensed on the internet . She felt so bad that she committed sucide . I found that horrible . A person should never comitt sucide , especially because some other person could not be nice . To sum up , computors are very dangerous . Computors are also addictive . To start off , it makes you spend less time with your family . ( not finished ! ) .",10.0,210,4.900408168230543,13.428571428571427,35,0.445859872611465,6.0,1.6624203821656052,1.5803341042062595,0.0148619957537155,35.0
9617,864,1,"Dear Readers , @ CAPS1 has come to my attention that there is a debate on whether or not computers benefit society . This issue is debatable but really I think that computers are not helping the big picture . I do not think that they benefit our health or social actions because computers keep us inside when we could be out . Everyday when I come home from school , I find myself going straight inside and to the computer from there , I log into @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3 . And my exersize in the next @ NUM1 hours or so is only in my fingers . My point is that there is a whole world outside of we only got off our computers and played outside . Statisctis show that @ NUM2 kids spend more time inside year - round than out these days . "" @ CAPS1 is ridiculous how much things have changed in just @ NUM3 years . "" says @ PERSON1 a pediatrician in @ LOCATION1 , "" they all need thier exersize . "" @ CAPS1 is cutrogeous how much people are on computers now , @ CAPS1 starts to affect thier attitude , and control thier lives . Sometimes checking notifications on @ CAPS3 can be more important to someone than spending time with thier family or friends . A mom of @ NUM4 teens says "" They all go to thier rooms , shut thier doors and go on @ CAPS3 and @ CAPS6 untill dinner and after , they go right back . "" In this case , they just plug into thier computers and forget about everyone else . I think @ CAPS1 has gotten out of hand how much people and teens especially are addicted to computers . 1 / @ NUM4 mom says she sees her kid growing apart from the family because of a computer . You @ MONTH1 say that when on your computer there is a person you are talking to , and while pen - pals are great , you should really go out and do something ! You are talking your friends , but it is not the same as being with them . On my recent trip to @ LOCATION2 to go skiing , I found that some of my friends jokes funnier when you are with her and not just sitting on a computer . We had a blast ! Now I regret not getting together with her to hang out . Also @ NUM6 arguments now , have something to do with a missunderstanding through the computer , people @ MONTH1 get the wrong message when you send something to them or they take @ CAPS1 the wrong way . The truth is , computers are starting to take negative effect on our society and even ruin relationships . If we just get off our computers and get out , we can turn that around .",10.0,217,4.421686761565718,18.608695652173914,23,0.5058275058275058,5.0,1.5034965034965035,1.1916036365433171,0.03962703962703962,23.0
9619,1221,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 or @ LOCATION1 , @ CAPS2 people believe that computors are harmful to our society because people spend more time on such technology . I believe that this is not the reason our society is falling today although I agree that people spend to much time on the computor . Computors are actually helpful in our society because it is an advance in communication . People have found ways to communicate with other people through plugging in a web cam and mic . Not only does the computor help communication but it also helps us gain information on modern day society like the news to stay up - to - date . This complicated device can also save files and documents by typing them in so that if it is lost you could just reprint it out . One main thing that people of modern day technology usually do is talk to faraway friends and family on spare time . Legal websites allow people to be informed of a friend or family about events that have ocurred like an incident or an up coming event . @ CAPS2 experts like @ PERSON1 , who specializes in the behavior of people , says that this is a number one cause of obeisity and prevents people from meeting other people outside or even plain exercise . I would say this is not completely true because before even talking to anyone . Online people usually go for a jog around the neighborhood . Information is vital in our society and keeps us up - to - date on modern life . A computor can give us certain information like news and whether report . These days every smart person would go search information on a computor for not only missed news but for future forecast on whether to plan a picnic . This would be a helpful tool to our society in order to keep up with the world and not miss the latest event . I believe this is an advance in our modern day society because you could get the information you need . When you are in a rush to go to work do not you end up losing papers and files just forgetting about them ? The computor can send data to a computor to conviently copy a file or document so you will not have to rush to work and worry about lost files . It has been known that thirty out of fifty people have saved themselves from losing a job from a computor . The computor can also hold and store data for later use like a song or picture . You could send that file and listen to it on another computor . Now is the time to decide if you should support computors . The computor can help you talk to long lost friends of one touch of a button . If you need certain information than you could find it on a computor without ever leaving your comfortable home . last and not least you could hold important files and documents and save yourself the trouble from rushing to work . So go and type that letter to a representative to help people see that computors are good for our society .",10.0,233,4.637133691691936,19.76923076923077,26,0.4524271844660194,6.0,1.6271844660194177,0.9305861291319929,0.017475728155339806,26.0

Computers in schools help to increase the amount @ MONEY1 learning our children . @ CAPS1 example , @ PERSON1 can study their math facts online @ CAPS1 math or learn about the skeletal system @ CAPS1 health classes .

While @ CAPS3 can be debated that computers are bad , i firmly disagree . Computers are one of the best technological advances the human race has made . they have helped education , reconnecting , and are even at times good for the environment . I wonder why people disagree , and i hope that after reading this , you will too . At my schoo , there are three computer labs , each with about twenty five computers , a library with twenty computers , and each teacher has two computers in their classroom . Wheni look at these amounts and addit to what i know about computers in other @ CAPS1 schools , @ CAPS3 is clear to me that computers have helped the education system . Many teachers can have students research projects with the click of a button . There are websites where students who were out from school can get their assignments for the next day . Also , teachers can put their grade books in their had drive . This saves paper and ensures accuracy in the final grade . As a student , i think that computers have greatly improved schools in many ways , but mostly in those above .

Now let me explaine more about what a positve effect the computer is for the millions of people that use one . The computer today is such a great thing to have in your house . It is not for just ga off and playing video games on , it is also very helpful in the education of young children , teens , parents , and even grandparents . when you use the computer there os so much you can learn . For instance lets say you have a in your socical or history about the country or and you do not know a thing about it . What do you do ? You should log onto you computer find a reliable website and boom you are learning facts about @ LOCATION1 that you would have never know until you logged onto the computer . The computer is also a great way to practice and get better using your hand - eye coordination . First you need to learn about the of the keys and where they are positioned on the keyboard . After you have that skills , you should try to look at the computer screan . and not be working down at you finger keys . Not only is that not helping you hand - eye coordination , but it is causing you to type much slower than you would if you were looking at the screen . The computer truely is unbelievable . Are you one of those people who is parents do not you get a phone because use of how much it costs without even the cost of texting ? we will if you are , the computer help you out with that problem aswell ! There are bunches of different ways to talk to your friends and family on the computer . For example , you could use @ CAPS1 to instant your friends or facebook to learn more and more about somebody . The comp . is so hanndy ! So lets recap on what we learned ! The computer helps people learn about different places all over the world helps w / hand - eye coordination , and lets you talk to your friends !

9628,7,1,"Did you know that more and more people these days are depending on computers for their safety , natural education , and their social life ? In my opinion , the increasing use of computers is not benefiting society . Initially , ones safety while using a computer is at risk . To begin , when someone is talking to another on a computer , they @ MONTH1 never know who is at the other end of it . For example , @ CAPS1 a small girl was playing a game on the computer and a person began talking to her , it could be a predator . She will never know unless they meet us somewhere . At this point , it maybe too late . Moreover , studies show that @ PERCENT1 of people ' s information is more widely exposed in the last @ NUM1 years due to the new chat websites . Such as myspace and facebook . In these websites , people share their information . With this , their safety is at risk . Finally , people should stop using computers as much as they are now , in order to keep their safety safe . Furthermore , enjoying nature is a must , in our world full of immense landscapes , wide waters , dense forests , and lush valleys . @ CAPS1 you depend on your computer to teach you about the world , you should cease this use . One must actually be outside , experiencing the feel , the smell , and even the taste of nature . A recent study shows that people who actually went to the grand canyon could write a @ NUM1 page essay on what they had learned . The people who did not go and simply read information off their computer , could not write this much . Finally , society needs to back away from their computers , and stop into . Thirdly , a person ' s social life could be ruined from the use of computers for many reasons . One reasons for this could be that a person spends all their time on their computer instead of spending time with their family and friends . Sure , you can chat with people online , but that is nothing like chatting in person . There is no need to talk to a friend or family member online , when you could do it in person . Finally , @ CAPS1 someone takes an embarrasing picture of you and puts it on their computer , it is there forever . Thus , you can lose friends , whether you are the person in the picture or the addict who put the picture on . With this , you can easily ruin your family / social life by using your computer too often . How would you feel @ CAPS1 it was your fault that someone ' s safety is at risk ? would not you rather enjoy nature in person instead of which it on your computer and not get the fall effect ? could not you talk to your friends and family in person rather than ignore them to use your computer ? There are numerous ways in which the increasing rate of computer use does not benefit society . I encourage you to agree with me that computers can put one safety at risk decrease their education of nature and ruin their social life .",10.0,227,4.809698203614216,16.933333333333334,30,0.44597249508840864,6.0,1.6090373280943024,1.3730174851339658,0.009823182711198428,30.0
9629,1639,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 you know , more and more people are starting to use computers . In my opinion , I think the computer does benefit society in many ways . One positive effect it has on people is that they can communicate . Through the computer , people are able to send messages to each other . If someone does not have a phone or car , they can simply go online , write a message , and click the send button . This is an easy way to communicate with someone who lives half way around the world @ CAPS2 we will . If you have family members who live far away , you can also send them pictures of yourself , friends / family , and places you have been to . They can receive them and also send pictures back . Another positive effect computers have on people is that they can learn new things . The internet allows you search different topics and basically has everything and anything you could ever think of . If you go on @ ORGANIZATION1 and type in a word like ' dog , ' you will see a bunch of websites that will take you to other websites that are just about dogs . You can find a list naming types of dogs , how old a dog can live up to , where most dogs are found , how to care for them we will , etc . The internet lets you explore new things and help find ideas . You name it ; they got it . The computer also cames in handy when you have nothing to do . If you are bored and can not play outside because the weather is bad or you broke your leg , you can play computer games , listen to music online , or write your own story on a word document . Playing computer games can teach you techniques to help play a game better , @ CAPS2 we will @ CAPS2 keep you busy . If you want to listen to music to keep yourself entertained , you can go on @ CAPS3 or other sites and find any song you want to hear . it is better than listening to the radio because sometimes you do not like the song that is giving . If you are also in the mood to write a story , you can open a word document or if you just want to type what is on your mind . @ CAPS2 you can see , I think the computer is a facinating tool to use . You can communicate , learn new things , and keep yourself entertained if you are not able to do something active . Just remember , whenever you can , go out and play or hang out with friends and family .",10.0,187,4.400179248671639,18.608695652173914,23,0.4358974358974359,5.0,1.5804195804195804,1.208830175294948,0.013986013986013986,23.0
9630,1598,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , I think the effects that computers have on people are bad , and should be stopped . I mean do not get me wrong computers help people , but a lot of people go on it everyday , some computers can get viruses , and there are much more activities to do other than on a computer . I hope to persuade you about the horrible effects a computer has on people . Do you know how many people use the computer ? we will , according to @ ORGANIZATION1 over @ NUM1 billion people use a computer worldwide . The problem we are facing today is that too many people are on a computer , most of them are teens . According to @ PERSON1 about @ PERCENT1 of teens spend most of their time on an computer . Facebook , @ ORGANIZATION2 , @ CAPS1 , and @ CAPS2 are the most common places to find teens . I would know that because I have a facebook myself . I had had one for almost a year , and you should see all the people who have one . My friend wanted me to get one because she said she had one one wanted me to get one too . So I did and then I found out that more then half of my grade had a facebook . In my own words I honestly think the computer can be addicting , especially when your on a worldwide account like facebook . There are many people on the computer and if must be stopped . In addition , another reason is computers occasionally get viruses . According to @ CAPS3 . com , the average adult gets about @ NUM2 to @ NUM3 viruses a year . My friend @ PERSON2 was on his computer typing a report , and then his computer shut down . Then @ NUM4 seconds @ CAPS4 the computer said you have a virus . The next day @ PERSON2 told me he did not have his report because the virus wiped out all his information . About @ PERCENT2 of viruses can cause a computer to shut down and it is hard to reboot it . Some places have made virus scans such as mcafee . and @ CAPS5 , but sometimes they can not catch the virus . @ PERCENT3 of people who say that a virus was cought by the virus scan they have , their computer freezes up and you can not delete the virus , viruses must be terminated , so the computer can work properly . that is another reason to why computers affect people in a bad way . Furthermore , people think that the computer is their everything . they are wrong ! There is a lot of activities that they can do other than be on a computer . According to @ CAPS6 . Burn the average person between the ages of @ NUM5 and @ NUM6 spend more then @ NUM7 hours on a computer . There are many other options of activities like call your friends and get together , that is why they invented the cell phone , play a sport , read a book , spend time with family for @ PERSON3 ' s @ CAPS7 ! do not spend all your time on the computer . About @ PERCENT4 of teens who are on the computer alot tend to get into lower colleges later in life . That is my final reason of the bad effects a computer has . In conclusion , computers can cause a bad influence due to viruses , too much time on it , and not doing other things . I hope you can see my point to this and please send me a response as soon as possible .",10.0,232,4.984137958870222,15.611111111111109,36,0.4120781527531083,5.0,1.55595026642984,1.3250112108241772,0.04440497335701599,36.0

Do you ever get bored and have nothing to do ? we will if you have a computer around , there are endless things to keep you busy . People can talk to their friends and keep in teach with them .

While social networks are great and all , computers can also make work extremely easy and proffesional - looking . They can also perfect the skill of hand - eye coordination . But with that in mind , is the computer truly a harmful or helpful device ? Sometimes we wonder where our long lost friends and relatives have gone and how they are . we will , with the computer and internet access , you can easily contact them through great social networks such as @ CAPS1 . I hear it all the time from everyone that reunions have been made , and friends have been reunited . And reuniting friends , you can also make new ones with a simple click of a button . is not making more friends and reconnecting so easy now ? Computers nowadays offer wonderful software from @ ORGANIZATION2 that can make making slideshows , projects , and reports far easier .

They teach to people hand - eye cordination , and about places all over the world . Computers are also great for talking online to family and friends . Computers teach people hand - eye cordination . They help people to get familiar with looking at a screen and typing letters to form words . Computers are excellent for students that play the piano , like me . It helps you to be able to look at the music and have your fingers know where to play . The computers helps with the piano because they both involve you looking at a screen , or music . While your fingers know what to do . So I think computers helps children and teens to have better hand - eye cordination . Computers are also very helpful to everyone because it is great for researching facts , or even just looking for somewhere to go on vacation . Say you just got home from school , and your teacher had assigned you to write a two page paper on the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 . You would not be able to do it by memory , you would need facts .

9637,107,1,"Dear @ LOCATION1 , @ CAPS1 your computer ever crashed , and you needed to do a presentation ? we will if so , that means you probably had to do your presentation on paper , the old fashioned way . Recently , there @ CAPS1 been a debate going on between experts about computers . Some think they make your life more efficient while others think they make you spend too much time on them rather than outdoors . I believe that computers make our lives easier and that the advances in technology have a positive effect on people . I think this because it teaches you skills and updates you on info . around the world , it is efficient for work and helps the environment , and lastly , it let ' s people stay in touch . Computers have a positive effect on people because it let ' s family members stay in touch . Emails are an example of this . Instead of mailing a letter , you are electronically sending it . The person recieves it quicker and can answer ina more timely manner . Also , social networking sites help families keep in touch . One example of this is facebook . You can see what the person is doing and chat with them using facebook chat . I relate to this . My cousin lives in @ LOCATION2 , so I do not see him a lot . Through facebook , we can talk and update each other on our lives . Lastly , you can see pictures of your family . Many families have accounts on photo sharing sites . This enables them to see pictures or recent vacations or sporting events . They can comment and every member of the family can see how everyone looks / changes throughout the year . That is how computers let people stay in touch . Another reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches you skills and updates you on information . Computers teach you hand - eye coordination . When you type with a keyboard , you have to know where each letter is . This makes it possible to lok at the screen to recognize my errors . Hand eye coordination is a good skill for everyone to know . Computers update you on world news . Many homepage on the internet have news engines built into them . These news engines keep people updates on major news events . For example , the war in @ LOCATION5 , or more recently , the @ LOCATION3 and @ LOCATION4 earthquakes . Without the internet , we would be very behind on important news updates around the world . My last reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it is efficient for work and they help the environment . Computers help the environment because you are not using as much paper . Throughout the year , @ CAPS2 use billions of sheets of paper to write letters . With computers that number goes down into the thousands . Why you @ MONTH1 ask ? Emails do not recquire paper . They are electronic , which means no paper . They are also environmentally friendly because news paper companies are going out of buisness . Due to online news paper news is becoming less and less popular . Computers are efficient for work because it is so easy to make presentations . There are so many programs to use , that making a big presentation could take minutes . That is why computers make work easy but help the environment at the same time . As you can see , computers have many positive effect on people . They let family members stay in touch , they teach you skills , and they are efficient for work while being environmentally friendly . That is why I believe computers have a positive effect on people . Let me ask you this question again . @ CAPS1 your computer ever crashed when you needed to do a big project ? Now you know that computers make life efficient . What would you do without them ? So now it is your turn , go out and buy a computer because you will be thankful you did .",10.0,266,5.584796799180851,12.307692307692307,52,0.41497659906396256,6.0,1.6926677067082685,1.395790502428197,0.0171606864274571,52.0

If people stop spending so much of their day on the computer , then they would not be having too many issues . People need to spend less time on computers , and spending more time exercising ! Computers all over the world do not involve much interaction with any part of your body other than your hands . You do not tend to want to get up or do anything else when you are on your computer , right ? we will that needs to change . Often , peolple get cranky while they are using a computer or if they need to get off of one . Some people are so obsessed , they might even break down and have a fit !

I can tell because all they eat is junk food . This needs to "" @ CAPS4 can not even have a little of time with his children . They should go on a family trip and enjoy together ! That brings us in next issue . We all need to enjoy nature more . Why would you spend your time on a computer looking of pictures of nature when you have it right there in your . it is because kids are too lazy to get off their lazy and go outisde . The best thing about nature is that if you are about need to be alone or even just need to get , nature is always there for you anytime you need it . You can laways go otside with your friends and family too ! I am sure that they would apreciate people getting off their computers to spend some quality time together . Yet again , our next and final issue . Computer obsessed teenagers and adults need to be with their family and friends . When talking to your friends why bother talking to them on the computer when you can just get together and go do something fun ? ALso , when you spend time with your family , it brings them a lot closer toy ou . Nobody likes to not talk to the people you love and the people who reised you . When you are on a computer I just think of all the places you could , place you could be with . Nobody wants to be distant from their friends and family .

There are good reasons of thinking such a thought that is in this time with such an eviormetal breakdwon we need to get close to nature while it is still here . Next today our interaction is very low when if your talking about actuall talking to the person and because of computers it makes @ CAPS3 all the more lazy while sitting around doing nothing .

In all , @ PERCENT2 of people agree with my idea about computers . Firstly , using computers teaches people about hand - eye coordination . For example , my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes we will because of using the computer . This is because she types and researches information all day long . In all , computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more .

How this benefits you is because @ CAPS2 you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them , then video chat . It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way . @ CAPS5 , instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes , go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat . Lastly , taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important . In conclusion , you will have great eye coordination , you will be able to research faraway places , and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online . @ CAPS5 , I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem .

All of these things are @ CAPS3 computers are doing to our society and it is time to make a stop to it ! First of all , people are on the computer way too much . Teens are on social networking sites , adults are on chatrooms , and kids are playing computer games . Instead of that , people should be playing outside , or going for a walk in the park . Did you know that @ PERCENT1 of adults are overweight ? If people cut back the amount of time indoors , we could probably bring that number way down . Also , who knows @ CAPS3 teens are doing on the computer . Computers have good things but they can also be bad . For example , chatrooms who knows @ CAPS3 kind of people are in chatrooms . Children need to be careful about @ CAPS3 they say or show on the internet . Instead of playing games or talking to their boyfriends and girlfriends , teens should go outside and exercise . Second , more citizens need to enjoy nature and the beautiful senery around them . Were all so busy running to check our e - mail , we do not notice @ CAPS3 a beautiful day it is outside . On a nice @ DATE1 or @ DATE2 day , people should take this kids to a local park or pond . This reminds me of last @ DATE2 when I went to @ CAPS1 cousins house . @ CAPS1 aunt only allowed us to watch one hour as a day , that included the computer . We were outside every single day , even if we were just staring into the clouds . This kept us active and enjoy the environment . @ CAPS1 last reason why computers are badly affecting society is that computers take time away from interacting with family and friends . I know @ CAPS3 your thinking , when your on the computer you are talking to family and friends , but it is not the same . Instead of instant messaging call them . Maybe even invite them our to talk face to face . That reminds me of @ CAPS1 sister . When I get home , she will normally be on @ CAPS2 . Now , instead of getting up and coming to talk to me she will text me "" @ CAPS3 ' s up ? "" or "" @ CAPS4 was your day ?

However , the truth of the matter is that some people spend way to much time on the computer . We miss out on all the other important things in life , just because of to much time on our laptops . Excessive use of the internet can lead to not enough exercise . It can cause us to be anti - social , And lastly , not allow us to enjoy the beautiful nature that surrounds us . Do you know that a very high cause of obesity is ? Electronics , kids sit on the computer all day long , while they should be out exercising and keeping fit . Sure , it is still okay to surf the web . You just have to keep the time minimum we could ensure this rule by having a time limit set at home . I myself love to use the computer , but i make sure to get off after about an hour . The whole idea of the "" internet "" is such a broad topic . That leaves us with so much to explore , we just have to keep on eye on the clock . There are so many forms of chat on the internet ; @ CAPS1 , @ ORGANIZATION1 , etc . Many people are always on one of those , instead of talking in person . We can eventually become anti - social due to so much time spent on the computer . Although yes , you can be talking over the internet , it is necessary to be talking to people face to face , it is as if we become grued to the computer . Websites such as @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3 are also causes of this . People get addicted and are on them constantly , @ CAPS4 "" @ CAPS5 "" websites actually take away time that could be spent with friends . So instead of having a chat over the computer screen , plan a meeting in person . do not allow the computer to let you loose the social skills that you have built up . I love going outside each season to see the beautiful nature that surrounds us if you spend to much time on the computer , you will not have time to enjoy it .

So the next time you think about going to surf the web or play that new computer game , i hope you think about my opinions i presented to you . Too much time on the computer causes us to not get enough exercise , and we can become anti - social . we will not be able to enjoy the nature around us .

Computers are also not becoming a important and learning , making informationeasier to before . The most popular and common of a computer now is communication . Websites are invented on the main idea of communicating . Computers are a important part of the future life that is not harmful or unnessary . Resently we have been able to use computers in so many helpful ways . Learning and studying new and important things . Researching and collecting data to cure a desies to working on a machicene .

Like a job you print out a paper every week or day even . You use computers to edit and put together your paper before printing .

Computers are a optional thing for people to use in their own time required to do . The person could go out and see friends and family . Go to the gym , a vacation without a computer . Yes they are fun to use they have a lot of things to do it is not needed like air or water . You can live without using a computer for us a week . You can take a walk , read a book , go hangout with your family and will not be pressured for computer time at all . If your worried about it take a break from it for a while . You can do things without a computer . Learning with computers is thing lately , in @ CAPS2 they are going in the computer lab learning to read on or other programs .

Talk to far away friends and family without high phone bill . Seeing politics and daily news to the weather . Almost all means of communication can be done with a computer .

Online communication has affected people because there is an easier way to talk to other instantly . Just a push of a button , and you have immediate communication with someone . Finally , people have the ability to type on a program if they wanted to type a letter or story . For instance , if you use microsoft word , you can type up whatever you want .

Read on to find interesting details about computers and their positive effect . @ CAPS4 first reason that computers are positive is that it can help you with your education . I mean come on , how many college students do you see without a laptop ? You see none . Am I right ? You always need a computer because you have to type eveything , and do research for big essay papers . People think "" we will , there ' s always the library ? "" @ CAPS1 your wrong . @ CAPS4 local library closes at @ TIME1 pm . I am sure college students are yo way later than @ TIME1 doing homework .

What are you going do ? @ CAPS1 , you better get yourself a laptop before the next giant essay comes ! @ CAPS2 , even if you did go to the library , who wants to log all of your books down stairs , and drive to the library and then finally get there and realize you forgot something . that is just a waste of time ! Next , computers are positve because you can talk to your friends and family . For one it saves a load of money because email does not cost anything ! I have a @ ORGANIZATION1 ! email and I do not pay a cent for it ! With a cellphone you have to buy the phone and pay the bill every month . Did you know the average american spends atleast # @ NUM2 each month on cellphones ? it is out @ CAPS2 , what if you never see a certain family member ? I know @ CAPS4 cousin just had a baby and her dad lives in @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS3 . So , she got a webcam , and now everyday they talk , and her dad gets to see the baby . They think the they always talk about everything day , and other things . After , I have just said all these wonderful things , you look someone in the eyes and then than that computer do not help people . For @ CAPS4 final reason , computers are positive because you could gain hand - eye corrdination , @ CAPS4 brother , @ PERSON1 , loves , and I mean obssesive love , loves video games . he is addicted to them ! He can not stop playing them , and I do not mind at all . I do not mind because now he can chew gum , jotdown ideas for his essay , think about what is he is gonna have for lunch , and play a video game . how is that for multi tasking ! @ CAPS2 , you will be healthier .

Although many people would look upon computers on a negative note , the computer allows us to do essential task needed in everyday life . Many people feel that the applications on a computer are @ CAPS1 keeps us away from doing other productive activities , but the applications a computer holds is neccessary for must tasks . Apps suchn as the calculater saves time from doing all the work on a piece of paper . It allows you to do simple or complex math in just less than @ NUM1 seconds . it is a great for finding how much a tip is , financial reasons such as now much you have to save , or even dung same basic math or science homework . Another great application is note taking that can easily be typed . This application allows you to take notes by typing , which again eliminates the need to write with a pencil or a paper . Note taking on the computer can be used for easy to read notes to study from to get a good grade on an upcoming test or quiz . The most important and must commonly used application on a computer device is the internet . The internet has over millions of websites for many reasons . If you plan to go to the movies tonight , the internet will surely give you movie times , directions , and how long the movie will be . It is also a great way to plan family trip or to book flights and such . Considering this , the apps are very useful . The computer is also a great device to use for learning . It allows you to look online about new subjects such as far away places or people @ CAPS1 would our country be line if we were not educated on the outside world around us ? It is also a great learning technique for research . Our teachers today gives us many projects and assignments to learn about new things , and @ CAPS1 a great way to research our topic than on the computer . The fashion of the @ NUM2 and @ DATE1 is just a project I did last month . The computer allowed me to find the garment both women and men wore , @ CAPS1 material they were made from , and even now they managed to buy and get the material . The research from my computer gave me a great understanding on my topic and helped me to learned the basics of my topic . You would probably agree that communication can be used in negative ways , but communication is @ CAPS1 keep our world spinning . The computer device is one of the many devices used for communication . Email on a computer allows you to send messages to a single or multiple people whatout the need of signal or service . Blogging is also a way of communication on a computer and gives you freedom to express your feeling on education on a certain topic . The instant message is probably the must used by teens . It is quick . It allows you to quickly talk a person without waiting , for reply for more than days .

Though having a computer @ MONTH1 cause children to play uneducational games , computers teach more and help children as we will . I know for your company , having no computer would be a nightmare . It gives education to not only children , but adults as we will . First of all , computers are proven to be the second best source of education , behind school , along with the best source of information . Millions of websites are specified to only education of all kinds . Not only are there websites . these are @ CAPS1 ' s with online tutors or just work . Computers provide practically anthing you need . For work , adult use . computers to sell something communicate with someone or just look up a new topic . The technology of a computer is farther than any other item . Without a computer life would be much more difficult . Instend of just sending an email , mail would have to be sent out . Most information would have to from brooks . In fact even the internet has books to buy and read . I am aware that people feel that children are spending too much time on the computer talking to friends , but children need to be social , @ CAPS2 it weren ' t talking on the computer , there would just be more texting and calling . The computer makes life so much easier that to take it away would cause stress and less time for other important activities . Lastly . computers have documents and it is the best way to type . Your company can definetly agree that without typing documents life would be a mess . Everyone writes up documents and needs to send them , open them up again , and edit them . The only other access to typing is a type writer . Types writers can not save anything , delete and do half the work computers do . Your whole job depends on the computer and typing . How would you feel @ CAPS2 you could not use a computer . In conclusion , computers are a necessity to our living . Without computers life would be difficult and stressful .

More and More people use computers , but not everyone agrees that this benefits society . Those who suffort advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people , but there are negative effects too . I believe that computers are a negative effect on people vecause people spend too much time on computer ; not exercising , there are many dangers , and less interacting with family and friends . First @ ORGANIZATION1 all , a negative effect computers have on people is that they spend too much time on the computer and that leads to less exercise . Recently , @ CAPS3 spoke to a local @ CAPS2 about this issue and she spoke out , @ CAPS3 have one family computer and my son is the one who is always on it right after school to late at night . "" This shows that many children are on a computer too much . I have to input that I personally sit on my computer at times and not even realize two hours past . I try to cut back on my computer times , but it does not really work out . Sitting on the computer for hours everyday is also looking exercise . The hours used up on the computer could be the time in which you are exercising . someone ' s health is very important now . Spending too much time on the computer and not getting exercise is a major negative effect computers have on people . Secondly , the most concern parents have @ ORGANIZATION1 computers are the many dangers , which is another negative effect it has on people . Recently the new biggest site is facebook . So many people are addicted to it . Though , it is not that safe all the time . Another new thing is oovoo or skype , which allows you to talk to someone with webcam . There could be a time when a teen "" meets "" someone on - line and agree to do things on the webcam for someone they do not really know to see . These sites are not safe , and knowing youngs they can in danger . @ CAPS3 spoke to some researchers about this and they would agree that these sites are @ PERCENT1 dangerous to young teens . All these dangerous risks as another negative effect computers have on people . Lastly , another negative effect computers have on people is there is less interactions with family and friends . Instead @ ORGANIZATION1 getting together with a friend people just go on the computer to talk . That is not the same as an actual get together . I actually enjoy family parties . Seeing all my aunts , uncles , and cousins it so much better and fun . I do e - mail my family and friends when I do not see them , but I get excited when @ CAPS3 have get togethers . Now a day it is not like that for a lot @ ORGANIZATION1 people . Many people work long times and spend too much time on the computer , which takes time away from interacting with others , and that should be more important . The computer also , negatively effects people with interacting with family and friends . In conclusion , I see computers as a negative effect on people . Computers make people spend a lot @ ORGANIZATION1 time have dangerous risks , and take away interaction time . I strongly suggest you look over my terms .

9666,72,1,"Hello , I decided to write in to the paper on the topic of computers , and how they benefit society . Comuters are powerful machines , and can be used completing otherwise menial and boring tasks . They benefit people in many ways , like they are very useful in buissness , helpful in education , and connect friends and family together . Computers are uselful in buissness and are an extremely important tool in a common workplace today , and make work get done much more efficiently than if they did not have computers . One reason Computers are so useful in the workplace is because computers can storee far more data that can be put on paper . Also , they can do jobs and processes very quickly , which is important in the workplace . They can also be used for sending important information quickly and without much trouble . These are all valid reasons comuters are beneficial in buissness , and help things get done . Computers are important today ' s schools and educational programs becasue they can help students work in a more efficient fashion . "" @ PERCENT1 of all surveyed students said they would rather type a paper for school than write on by hand , and shows that they value them in their education . "" said @ PERSON2 , a professor at @ ORGANIZATION1 . This shows that Computers are important to students , and are used their benefit . In addition to students writing papers , computers are being used by teachers and school systems for grading , attendance records , and more . The teachers at my school are using @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 , pieces of hardware that are directly connected to computers , and can be used instead of white @ CAPS2 , and I see that students are getting more involved in class , and focused , because this computer technology is being used . All of these @ CAPS3 are reasons computers are helpful in educational proceeses , and should continue to be used . Many people want to be able talk to there friends and family when they are bored , and because of computers and social networking websites , and instant messaging programs , this is made much easier . "" @ PERCENT2 of teens have at least one sacial networking site they visit on a regular basis . "" said @ PERSON1 , a phycologist , who speciaizes in teens , This shows that people use these sites , and that they like them . Families that are separated because one @ MONTH1 have moved out of the house recently might want to communicate with one another , and because of computers , they can .

Unlike books , which you must find and buy , there is an enormous amount of information just a mouse click away ! With computers , you can learn about far away places and people without having to visit or talk to them . Let me compare this to a book . Let ' s say you wanted to do research on @ PERSON1 .

With a computers you could type "" @ CAPS2 of @ PERSON1 "" into a search engine and receive of information in under a minute ! I love saving time , and computers help me do that .

You see many residents just dying to go to foreign countries but have no money . Is this what you want every home to start looking like ? Computers have a great affect on people seeing as it allows people to talk and interact with one another . You can learn about places you have always wanted to go to and it is probably the device that makes your life easiest . For these reasons computers are what benefits society most . First of all , computers let friends and family talk without spending a nickel . I know I have relatives who are too poor to pay the high costs of phone bills that come their way when we need to talk this means that not everyone can afford talking on a phone , but a computer costs nothing to use . Also , in the @ ORGANIZATION3 issue @ NUM1 , @ DATE1 @ NUM2 a recent poll showed that @ PERCENT1 of people who own computer use it to talk instead of on a phone . I know some people say that computers are too time consuming , but if this many people use computers to talk , there ' s no need to worry about paying phonebills . Also , @ PERSON1 a @ CAPS2 of @ ORGANIZATION4 says that less people needed a loan when the computer came out with instant messaging and video chatting . This shows that friends and families stopped paying massive phonebills and just talked online . Furthermore , just from using a computer anyone can find facts about lands halfway across the @ LOCATION1 . what is more is that they can be in the bedroom or room . A boy name @ CAPS3 @ PERSON4 who attends @ ORGANIZATION1 said that he always wanted to go to when he was little and was as when he looked up @ LOCATION2 and facts and pictures on the web . Also , @ PERSON3 a teacher at @ ORGANIZATION5 @ ORGANIZATION1 task a poll asking how many students did projects having to do with foreign countries and @ PERCENT2 of them they did . That means that so many people need to resourced foreign countries and need to use a computer to find out about it . It shows that many more use computers to visit faraway lands . Last but not least , computers are just about the convenient thing to have in a recent poll done by @ ORGANIZATION2 showed that @ PERCENT3 at people would rather have a computer than a car that just shows the important computers are . Also , I used to think computers were bad for you and everything , but when I received one for my @ NUM3 birthday , I found out how useful they were . Many people say computers are time comsuming because they have not used one yet . Also did you know that million people use a computer that is more than half their population and such a poor country ? That shows her important computers are and how convenient .

9672,572,1,"Dear leader of the local newspaper , I have heard the strange misconception that computers are ruining our society . I for one , think that this is a terribly made thought . To begin , the internet ( provided with most home desktop computers ) can teach us a lot about the world around us . Additionally , the whole fact of contacting others around the globe , as we will as having a whole fun world to explore , makes computers more enjoyable . Finally , thousands of jobs around the world are either based on or work with computers . Due to this , computers are , without a doubt , beneficial to society . The first reason I need to clearly point out is that the computer holds tons of information that can not be found anywhere else . While books have to be republished as updates occur in the world , anything on the internet can be updated almost instantly , beneficial to students with school projects for subjects like @ CAPS1 , subsequently , people could actually go to school via online schools and colleges . Whilst regular colleges could cost around thousands of dollars in order to get in , online colleges are much rather cheap , affordable to anyone . Also , due to the high amounts of information online , schools seem to be growing obsolete as computers typically hold all information obtained in a regular school year . Because of this , computers are definately beneficial to society . To build up , the internet provided with computers can bring loads of pleasure to those who use it wisely . Because of the growing population of those who use computers , companies tend to make computer shoes , which usually attracts viewers by the thousands each day . This makes television seem obsolete as we will . Another major thing is that software comes out for the computer almost everyday , allowing many things to be done by users . Software typically includes games , movies , and music . Finally , since staying in touch with others is a good thing , chatting with others across the globe is very easy and durable , allowing distant relatives to come in contact with you via various chat programs . Due to this , computers can bring loads of fun to users , and are thus beneficial to society . Lastly , due to the rising demand of computers , companies typically rely on computers for jobs . Since the internet population is growing , companies allow people to fill out applications and send in resumes in order to apply for a job in said company . Also , some jobs can only be done while online or using a computer . Many jobs these days , typically banks , rely on using the internet most of the time , and some actually are based in the internet . Because of this , workers can finish the job easily in one place , instead of having to around and going to a boring looking building to do a boring job . With this reason , why does not anyone else see why computers are beneficial to society ? With all of these reasons , I hope you see why computers are beneficial to society . Education just become a whole lot easier thanks to the internet . If education is not what you seek , you can then use the internet to have fun when you are bored . Finally , jobs can be completed even easier , and makes workers more responsible . So , leader of the paper , do you really , along with everyone else , think that computers are a waste of time in life ?",11.0,255,4.734326579738919,19.310344827586206,29,0.4545454545454545,6.0,1.7433155080213905,1.2474241244334552,0.0035650623885918,29.0

Not everyone agrees that technology is benefit to our growing we will , but I believe it keeps us moving forward and away from ignorance in all of it is forms .

They vigorously build sley scraping towers , educational fucilities , additions to our health center , and even the very places we call home . However , when weather is not on their side and building anything can be hazzardous in the long run , they must still ramain at the ready when duty calls .

To one it @ MONTH1 seem like all they do is seat themselves in a pull a few levers , and push a few buttons . However , there is in fact a persition to such a task .

One of feild reponters tried the @ CAPS1 virtual trainer and found a @ CAPS1 appreciation for the jobs at our builders . That just goes to show that @ CAPS5 one does not keep such skill in check , they could in fact cause a serious malfunction on a construction site .

However , @ CAPS5 I did not have a computer at home , my studies would be near impossible . With @ DATE1 ' s economy going to a class outside & school , or even hiring a personal tutor , can be enough to effect anyones budget emensly . The internet provides an efficient low casting , or even free , way to help any language learner .

Thousands upon thousands of sites and applications are now at your fingertips . I firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelming positive . For one thing , they increase hand - eye coordination . For another , they are a great means of communication . Finally they are a very powerful research tool . Some @ MONTH1 say that computers are lessening time with family and friends , but I do not agree . Computers help us stay more conected than ever ! The computer is not evil - quite the opposite ! First of all , computers are great for increasing hand - eye coordination . In recent study by @ PERSON1 , he noticed a significant increase in motor skills of children aged @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 when they used educational computer programs such as @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 for just half an hour , once a day . Children who did not use the program were seen to develop motor skills at a much lower rate . Hand - eye coordination is a skill needed from birth to death , and should be encouraged as uch as possible . I know that @ CAPS1 greatly helps me in my daily life - and probably you in yours as we will - from the mos basic tasks of eating and brushing my teeth to typing , drawing , and playing piano . As you can see , hand - eye coordination is very important . Second in my reasoning is that computers are brilliant communication aids . People can not always be reached by phone . An email could be waiting for them online whenever - and whereever - they check @ CAPS1 . Also , documents can be sent over email that would be near impossible for a home phone and difficult for most cells to process . Revolutionary video - conferencing programs like @ ORGANIZATION2 can even allow us to talk to people around the world , practically eye to eye . I use @ CAPS1 to keep in touch with family on the @ LOCATION2 . How about you ? Last - but ( at the risk of sounding cliched ) definitely not the least - computers are very powerful research tools . Everything from the schedule of the local zoo ( thus preventing toddler meltdowns when one arrives only to find @ CAPS1 closed ) to the average life span of the @ CAPS4 elephant ( @ NUM3 years ) . Rather than skimming book after books for a single piece of information , plug your query into any of many search engines , from @ ORGANIZATION1 to @ CAPS5 . and find answers instantly . Find about @ LOCATION3 without the expense of a plane ticket . See photos of @ LOCATION1 - a sight most people would never get to see without the internet . The computer can take us anywhere . In conclusion , computers are a great resource that are often wrongly portrayed in a bad light . Computers teach and improve valuable hand - eye coordination . Also , they help greatly with communication . And finally , they are a powerful research device . Computers are oftern shown as the bane of society . This is simply untrue .

I believe that computers are very useful tools for learning and communication , but people today over use that power . You know what I mean @ NUM1 gamers , @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3 addicts . Or those who will do anything just to spend time on the computer . People like the @ CAPS4 do not spend much time with family members , or friends , or even just outside . They do not get enough exercise , and frankly , abusing computers is not good for your life , physically or socially . Some people are working all day , leaving early in the morning and getting back late , so that they rarely spend time with those they love . But if you are hooked on the computer , as so many of us are , you @ MONTH1 just not spend enough time with family and friends . Using a computer is not exactly a social thing . One person with a mouse , a keyboard , and a monitor . You @ MONTH1 say "" @ CAPS5 , but there are also online social networks . "" @ CAPS5 , but how often do you even see those people in real life ? Computers can take precious time away from you that you could be sharing with your family and friends . That certainly does not benefit society . A major fault in computers is that you have to be indoors . So you cannot be online chatting , or playing a game , or checking your email , outside while enjoying the beauty of the outdoors . Sure you could use a laptop outside but are you really enjoying the outdoors ? Computers and outdoors go together like chocolate milk and fillet mignon - not we will . That is the reason why pine tree ' s do not have outlets ( although now you never know what they will do next ) . Another side effect - that goes allong with the aforementioned statement about computers and outdoors - of computers is the lack of exercise . Once again , it is rather difficult to use a computer and jump rope at the same time . When you live as a computer vegetable , your not getting enough exercise as you could or would be . Another reason computers could lower your quality of life . Now , really , if you use the computer sparingly , and only when you needed to , or when it is nessecary you would really have none at these "" side effects . "" But face it , the ruth is , computers can be addicting . Wether it is waiting for a friend to come online or your trying to get to level @ NUM2 of "" @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 "" , they can get you hooked . The idea of this article is not to prevent you from using computers , but to make sure you use them like you eat double fudge brownies with walnuts and cream cheese frosting - springly . So , now you know , computers when used to much , at obsesive amounts , are similar to drugs in the way that they are so addicting . As long as you use them correctly , they are a very , very valuable tool to be used , but over used , can be problem causing , and even prevent you from spending time with family and friends , getting exercise and even spending time outdoors .

Typing homework is an easy alternative to handing in messy , unsophisticated work . The efficiency of a computer is also recognized when trying to accomplish seemingly simple tasks . Just imagine how often you would get lost without your directions from . Or how much you would mess up if you did not print out a recipe for dinner . Most importantly , computers are the virtual gateway to all sorts of entertainment . Whether you like playing computer games or even if shopping for the best deal is you game ; a computer will suit you . There are . Thousand of website to visit and even more games just waiting to be played . A computer is anyone ' s passport to leisure and enjoyments . So you make the choice .

9684,1135,1,"Recently , there has been debate about whether or not computers benefit society . Although each side has it is own reasons , computers do have a positive effect on people and on society . Computers are beneficial in several ways . With the use of computers , you have the ability to research and learn about foreign and local places you are able to communicate with others and the help people complete everyday tasks . At one point in everyone ' s lives , you need to know about local or even foreign places . It is completely unrealistic for someone to travel to every place they need to know about . This is where computers come in . Over the internet , you can research everything from the main staple of the diet in @ LOCATION3 all the way to the day the new year in @ LOCATION1 . You learn about things in the comfort of your home , or of your home town . I rember once in @ NUM1 grade I had to do a research project on @ LOCATION2 . By going on the computer , I learned all I needed to know and they some . The project was a breeze , and I got a perfect score . Also , you can learn about local upcoming events , and about the world around you . During childhood , every kid has many questions , some their parents might not be able to answer . Using the computer is a quick and easy way to get these answers . Computers help educate the minds of people and without them , we might not know anything . Communicating with people on the other side of the world is difficult . Mailing a letter could take weeks to reach the recipiant . Computers provide us with a imediate method of communicating with others whether they are local or far away . Last year , my uncle moved to @ LOCATION3 for work . I never got to see him . We communicated with each other over computers , and when he came home for christmas , we were as close to each other as we were before he work . Computers kept our relationship healthy and I do not think it would have been that way without them . Scientists say that about @ PERCENT1 of all @ CAPS1 have communicated with someone at least once through computers . They also say that @ PERCENT2 of these people regurally use this method of communicating . Although we still use phones and "" shall mail "" , I do not believe that our society would be able to function socially without the availiable use of computers . Everyday , computers are helping people get through their days with minimal problems . People get things done quicker , giving people more time to do what matters most , interacting with their families . Without computers , everyday business would take about twice as long leaving less time for the fun things in life . @ PERSON1 , my neighboor , said "" @ CAPS2 and banking are so time consuming . I do not know that I would be able to handle it without the ability to do my banking online . "" In addition to takes and hancing , computers help with everything from shopping to woking for the perfect phone company to use for your new business . Having the ability to shop and browse online takes away ariving , walking and checkout line time letting you relax and take your time throughout the rest of your day . Typing also gives you hand - eye coordination without it , you would not be able to do everyday things such as opening the door to playing sports outside with your children using computers helps people get through their lives easier and more efficiently , I could not even imagine life without them . Computers benefit the people of society in every possible way . By helping them obtain knowleage , purifying and strengthening relationships through constant communication ability , and helping make their everyday lives easier , they have a purely positive effect on people everywhere . Computers have a great effect on people and should continue to be used in everyday society .",11.0,289,5.055210879207248,17.45945945945946,37,0.44667697063369394,6.0,1.7109737248840804,1.3226010000039474,0.02472952086553323,37.0
9685,1777,1,"Dear Newspaper , Computers have advance a lot since they were first made . Some people see computers as a way to rot your brain , while others see it has a learning device . Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children , they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far away places and allow people to talk to each other online . To start off , computers are bad because they can be used as a way to babysit a child . When you are on the computer you are just sitting there staring at a screen with pictures and words on it . Some parents use the computer as a way to keep their kids quite , instead of taking the time to go outside . By growing up in an enviornment like that the children only know how to play on the computer . Kids have a lot of energy , and they need to do something productive , not play computer games and talk to their friends . All school day they talked to their friends , they need to be with family doing something to keep them fit and healthy . By using the computer as a babysitter , you as a parent are leading your child to obisity because all they do is games , and they are not properly taking care of their body . On the other hand , computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people . If your teacher gave you a last minute writing essay on @ LOCATION2 that was do in a week , what would you do ? You can not fly to @ LOCATION2 and ask the @ CAPS1 people what you want to know . That would be a waste of time and money . And if you go the library and they do not have any books , then you are in trouble . But by using the computer you can find endless information about @ LOCATION2 , and you could finish that essay in a day if you wanted to . Also , if you were going to @ LOCATION4 , but you knew nothing about @ LOCATION4 you would not be very confident about going . And you would feel like a tourist . But , if you went online and searched @ LOCATION4 , you could find the traditions , the clothing , and so much more . Lastly , if you wanted to know more about a famous person who is not around anymore , you could go on the computer and find pictures and what they did , how they became famous , and so on . Finally , computers allow people to talk online with other people . Say your grandma lives in @ LOCATION3 , and you can not call to often because your phone bill will get to high , what do you do then ? You talk online since you both have computers and it will not cost you to call . For example , my grandma and grandpa both live in @ LOCATION1 . When we call there it costs a lot because they are so far away . When they got a computer , we each bought a webcam and called them everyday on @ ORGANIZATION1 . Now , not only did we talk to them , but we also get to see them too . If your friend did not have a phone and you really needed to ask them for the homework , you could go online or on aim or facebook and ask them . You know you can always get an answer because everyone is always on the computer at some point of the day . Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children , they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far away people an places , and they allow you to talk online with other people .",11.0,231,4.7911242288711255,20.53333333333333,30,0.37439222042139386,5.0,1.5607779578606158,1.07462769858425,0.012965964343598054,30.0
9688,1581,1,"Some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on computers , and I believe that they are correct . Most kinds would perfer to be on the computer chatting with friends on line or spending hours on facebook but what is the point of this when there is a whole to explore , they do not enjoy natire like they should , and they spend less time with family and friends . If you are on the computer twenty four hours a day , seven days a week how are you supposed to get enough exersize ? we will that is the problem you do not get any exersize . Some might disagree with me but the truth is , moving your hand over the mouse does not count ! A recent survay has been conduched and @ CAPS2 said that out of the @ PERCENT1 of kids who own a computer @ PERCENT2 are over - weight or indanger of being over - weight . @ CAPS2 is sad to think that technology has taken over so much that @ CAPS2 is ruining poeples lives . I go in the computer @ CAPS1 too , but I am always sure to ride my bike after or go for a hike with my family @ CAPS1 of the times I have softball practice so I am not able to go on the computer anyway . Now what about the beautiful things in nature @ CAPS1 of us are missing ? The outdoors is one thing most of us take advantage on , some of us have @ CAPS3 seen a day - lily are at night and new ones grow the very next day . This a facinating are might @ CAPS3 see because they have a computer screen in front of their face . Kids really should learn to balance tecknology and the more important things in life like protecting nature and exercising . Yes , I know , that some will disagree by saying , "" but i am saying the rain forest , or the @ LOCATION1 , by being a member of this website . "" @ CAPS2 ' s true you are helping but doing @ CAPS2 yourself would feel a whole lot better . For example you could get a group and clean up the streets in your neighborhood or help plant trees in the park . The most important thing in life is family and friends , technology should @ CAPS3 get in the way of that . If you loose everything what is the one thing your will always have ? Loving family and friends of course ! If family is so importand then why would kid want to be on the computer than at a family picnic ? Is is because technology is taking over their life and clouding their vision of the more important things life has to offer . do not you sometimes wish you were a little kid again running bare footed a field with your parents ? That could be some what have if you got off the chair you have been sitting in for three hours straight and took a hike with your family . I might not be making much sense but being with family in person is better than instant messaging someone you just meet who lives half way across the world ! I know that a ton of people are going to disagree with me when they read this but , I think technology is ruining some peoples lives . If you think about @ CAPS2 a computer is like a @ CAPS4 - @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 , @ CAPS2 has a sugar sweet coating byt when you get the full force of @ CAPS2 , @ CAPS2 traps you in and will not let go . A computer is ruining lives and experts have a right to be worried about people ' s health ! All of us should get more exersize , spend more time in Nature , and be with family and friends more often than sitting on a chair glued to a computer screen .",11.0,265,4.638691637747119,23.18518518518519,27,0.4226475279106858,5.0,1.4752791068580542,0.8249802573478929,0.030303030303030307,27.0

I could not go outside , or hang out with friends just because I was stranded insided as they enjoyed the computer . I strongly feel as if computers do not benefit society . People spend too much time using the internet than exercising , nobody gets to enjoy the beauty of nature , and there is less interaction with family and friends .

Since adults are not doing there part by idolizing these kids to persuade them to run around outside and do something healthy . The kids need to step up for a change ! Did you know global warming is caused by the minimum density in the air ? If we have almost to no children or adults running around outside , our world is not flowing too we will .

Other reaasons include , citizens @ ORGANIZATION3 the world need an easier way to communicate with each other , and some people have to work at home . I know you as a @ ORGANIZATION3 would not want to upset as many people as taking away computers would . First @ ORGANIZATION3 all , think about the schools that the @ ORGANIZATION1 runs . Now picture this ; kids turning in eight page essays to their teachers , when typing it would have taken three . Imagine those kids the night before , scribbling words away with their cramped hands , typing to write as quickly as possible . These children have no computers , and therefore their teacher will have to take the time to try and comprehend the illegibal students ' handwriting .

His work gave him a computer , and he was back to tucking me in every night , and he still does now . If that was not a possible effect , then I do not know what is .

This crazy computing must end ! Although children are able to socialize using the computer , they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally . "" I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me . I tried as hard as I could , but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me , I died inside . I almost had no desire to live . "" That quote was said by @ PERSON1 , a former student of @ ORGANIZATION1 . He is as victim of @ CAPS1 - @ CAPS2 . Thousands of students just like @ PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad , and if not worse . The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @ PERSON1 ' s . If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one . In the past year , @ NUM1 @ CAPS1 - bully victim have committed suicide . Those are @ NUM1 lives that could have been saved ; @ NUM1 families that could still be together . This computer madness is losing lives , we cannot allow this to continue . Not only are computers causing emotional danger , but also physical . The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule . The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers . The many features of computers , such as instant messaging , music playing , and games , draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising , in front of a computer . Statistics show that the average obese child spends @ PERCENT1 their free time on a computer . The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day . In @ DATE1 , children spent @ PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @ PERCENT3 outside . Over the past @ NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology . These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children ' s day , making their physical condition even worse . Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues . As I conclude this letter , I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement . In conclusion , computers are harvesting @ CAPS1 - @ CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort . They also dictate time , and as a result , children become obese . We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better .

9696,1038,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 a world without computers . I picture it as a better place . Why would not you want to make the world better . Computers @ MONTH1 be helpful for work and business but young children are losing time to exercise , enjoy nature , and interact with family and friends . What do you prefer having computers or no ? In my opinion people would be better off without them . Lack of exercise is brought up countless times in society . Computers is one factor to blame with the @ LOCATION1 already being one of the most obese countries in the world who would want to add on to this cotastrofy . If the number of computers used in each household increase the amount of obese people in @ LOCATION2 will as we will . If computers take away exercise than health issues will more often and at a younger age . Dr . @ PERSON1 says "" if kids are spending more of their free time on the computer rather than increasing the risk of diabetes will increase for them "" @ CAPS3 it also a possible result in less exercise . Older citizens will be a big target for a heart attack . It is said that five out of six people could have stopped a heart attack just from taking same time out of their day to go to the gym or take a walk . No one should lose exercise over playing virtual games and instant messaging on the internet . Less people get a chance to enjoy nature when they are on the computer all day . If more people cared for nature then global warming would not be an issue . In my opinion the citizens of @ LOCATION2 would want to keep it more clean and be more about their . more people cared about nature and enjoyed it wildlife would be taken away from animals . People would put an end to what some people and companies are doing to nature . Lastly when your on your computer all day you do not realize what nature has to offer fresh air and animals . Or endless canyons needs to enjoy nature more , computer should not be in their way . would not most people that their relationships with family members and friends could be a lot stronger if they interacted and spent time with them instead of with their computer . @ CAPS2 how much a dinner conversation and family party could improve if people were closer with their family . Plus people need family . Your computer can not get you through the emotional pain if losing a loved one . @ PERCENT1 of people can get through difficult and stressful times with family . Last but not least your social life could improve if people were not on the computer all day . Not interacting with people could turn you antisocial and not fun to be around . No one wants to be that way . Also your computer might not be working all the time , but your family and friends always will be there . The world would be better off without computers . I think everyone that sits in their room on the computer could change their exercise , enjoy for nature , also family and friend relationships by getting off it and do things that they will actually benifit from . There is no need for a computer in your life , but do not speak for everyone . The question then is do we stop using computers or do we turn them off for good .",11.0,246,4.93592231133792,16.142857142857142,35,0.4346289752650177,6.0,1.5724381625441697,1.6373158662509977,0.015901060070671377,35.0
9698,509,1,"Dear editor of local newspaper , @ CAPS1 you know that the average person spends three or more hours each day on the computer ? The time taken up by staring at a blank screen can be spent helping the community , exercising , or simply having fun with others . All this valuable time is wasted because of computers , spending large sums of time on a computer lessens your time with family and friends , causes health concerns , and alternately @ MONTH1 became addictive . First of all , computers @ MONTH1 prevent you from spending time your family and friends . Often people come home from work or school just wanting to relax , so the seek comfort from the web . However , a more relaxing activity could be playing a game with your family or going out with your friends . After all , nobody lasts forever and your time with once everyday . This precious time is taken away by computer technology , which will last longer than any human and does not even provide comfort when someone is down . For example , a teenager would be on the computer who is making fun of them . This does not benefit the and the bullying could lead to depression deceded with her family or friends , they could probably share a few and make everyone feel good , @ CAPS2 , time spent on the computer is less spent with family and perends . Secondly , computers can bad for your health , at a the eyes , and people with trouble seeing . typing a lot way the need for spending more time on the computer gives you learn time for examples and often temple you if someone finds a website they really like , they will quite went to visit it often , perhaps even multiple times a day ! Along with websites , @ CAPS3 games and networks are also very popular and addictive . Computer addiction can lead to health problems ( as talled about before ) and withdrawal symptons when you try to stop . it is very important that people stop spending a lot of time on the computer to make sure an addiction is prevented before it can even start . In conclusion , computer technology is hurting the human race and could be preventing greater things to be happening in individual ' s lives . There is less time to do things with your loved ones , more negative impacts on your a rising number of computer addicts because of our modern technology . However , all there , could be prevented if people simply spent less time on the computer .",11.0,214,4.060423032734104,22.61111111111111,18,0.5245098039215687,6.0,1.6691176470588236,0.9182958340544896,0.01715686274509804,18.0
9701,1570,1,"Yes , I believe that computers benefits society because you can talk to other people , it helps you learn and lastly compoters are apart of todays technology . First of all , computers have really progressed from the old type writer we used to have . Computers have helped todays life for a few different reasons . With computers , they help us learn or find things we did not know . For example , if you have a project due on the @ LOCATION1 , then most likley you are probably not going to know much about it . If you go to the internet then you can find tons of things about it like who and what needs the @ ORGANIZATION1 for water , how long the @ LOCATION1 is , where it is located or anything else abot it . Also , another reason why computers help us learn is that , say your going to a new job interview and you have no idea where it is or how even to get there . If you type in the adress and the internet will give you directions . Even if you do not know when your favorite to show is on tonight just type that in and the answer will be right in front of you . Secondly , why I believe that computers do benefits society is you can talk to other people from across the state , country , or world , or even just down the street . Facebook and @ CAPS1 are very helpful as we will , because one of my best friends moved away in second grade . Just before about christmas i found her on facebook and now we talk and catch up because we have not seen each other in years , @ CAPS2 alone tak to her . Another reason why is that if someones mon or dad is away at war or oversea ' s then the kids and parents could talk to them by using email , skype , yahoo instant messenger , with the webcam or the telephone just @ CAPS2 alone just typing back and fourth . You could also just use it for a job buisness to talk to your co - worker or one of your workers on webcam to see things are going with profit , stores , etc . Lastly , why I think computers actually do help us is technollogy has come a long way . For example if you had to type something up you would of have to used a type writer and those things are hard to use . Today you just have to go onto @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 and type it out . @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 also has spell check , you could email it to someone , or even change the font , color , size of the font and much more . Another reason why is with iphones or i touches now you do not have to be at home you could take out either one and just use the internet for whatever you want to . To find an app , find how long the @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 is , or even just to order a pizza but technollogy has come a long way . So this is why I agree with that computers help benefit our society because you can talk to other people , it helps you learn new things you did not knew before and finally computers have changed a lot and they are apart of our technology .",11.0,239,4.281562475440358,25.809523809523807,21,0.4401473296500921,5.0,1.5119705340699816,0.8631205685666309,0.031307550644567216,21.0

However , I support these advances in technology and I believe that computers have a positive effect on people . They allow friends and family who live far away from each other to communicate and stay in touch . Computers @ CAPS7 allow easy access to the news and online textbooks which provides an enourmous amount of benifits to today ' s society . In the long run , doing more things by computer instead of on paper will save billions of trees ! @ CAPS7 , computers teach us hand - eye coordination which is a tremenciously important skill .

9704,1255,1,"Dear Newspaper , I read an article in the paper @ DATE1 debating whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people . Even though , I love my computer , I know that computers can have a bad effect on people . Computers can cause people to have a lack of exercise , lack of family and friend time , and lack of enjoying nature . Although , computers can help people in so many ways , they can also make things worse for people . In @ LOCATION1 the obesity rate has reached an all time high of @ PERCENT1 . A computer is a non active activity , so if you do use it you get no exersise . One time I played on the computer for two whole hours and gained two pounds . Your health is also very important . When you become overweight you get the risk of diabettes , high colestral , heart failure , liver failure , and more . My uncle is overweight and was just diagnosed with diabettes and now he regrets all the time he gave to his computer . Lastly , people @ MONTH1 say that computers create great hand - eye coordination . Computers might do that but is the hand - eye coordination ever used ? No , because that person is too busy playing on the computer can you see how computers can effect your health ? Eighty eight percent of @ CAPS1 voted that the most important thing in their life was their family and friends . The other twelve percent said that their computer or cell phone is their most important thing in life because they cannot live without it . Not spending time with your Family and friends is an awful thing to do . When my mom lost contact with one of new friends , @ CAPS2 regretted not spending so much time with them . Also , if you do not spend time with people it could lead to socializing problems . If the only thing you do is talk to people on the computer you develope speech problems . My neibor , who I have never talked too never really came out of his house he always seemed to be on his computer , and no one over . One day someone came over and they started talking outside . When I overheard a little of their conversation I could the words he had trouble saying and he did not have a good vocabulary . Lastly , you can also develope relationship problems . Not being able to see a real relationship . That is why computers can have a negative effect on not only you , but your family and friends too . In our daily lives we observe nature , and it is beauty . Spending time on the computer instead of enjoying nature is awful . For example , if I was to not go outside for a whole day , and I got to spend my time on the computer I would be miserable . Nature is a gift that should be given to everybody . Also the @ CAPS3 air is good for your body . Without @ CAPS3 air you would be taking in chemically changed air , which is not good for your body . Lastly , everyone reads on the internet about @ CAPS4 warming but why do we not take action ! If you spend your time on the computer you would not be able to help nature . I remember when I read about @ CAPS4 warming on the computer . So I took action and cleaned our lakes . That is why computers have a negative effect on people . Computers can be great in so many ways but it is how much time you give to your computer that is bad . That is why computers have a negative effect on our society .",11.0,247,5.153258562656591,15.68421052631579,38,0.4137353433835846,6.0,1.5996649916247907,1.3779630390761746,0.018425460636515914,38.0

I strongly support computers and believe they have a lot of potential . Computers make the work even smaler . They allow to talk to people thousands at miles away man instant . Also , you can reconnect with friends that you can not see anymore . For example , I used to go to an awesome @ DATE1 camp and I made same of my best friends there .

9708,98,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , In this new digital age , computors are beaming more and more advanced . You can do just about anything with computors now from talking to people , to learning about faraway places . It is not all as wonderful as it seems , though for people ' s lives have been ruined because of the internet . It is for that reason that computors are not a benefit to our society . With computors we can learn anyting , go shopping , and contact friends . For many , this deletes the purpose of going outside . You can live your entire life indoors . This lack of exercise can lead to obesity . Also , living this secluded lifestyle can cut off ties with your friends and family . In order to use computors wisely , we have to learn how to balance computor time with an active lifestyle . The problem is , not many people do that . Furthermore , going online too much has been known to produce a second life . With websites like @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 , and @ CAPS3 you can have a whole different online life , with friends that you have not even seen before . Sometimes , people have even been known to think that their online life is better and get sucked into it . Take @ CAPS4 of @ CAPS5 for example . It is very popular , but also extremly addicitve . Some play until their entire lives are devoted to playing . Same with @ CAPS6 of @ CAPS7 . This obsession with online games or @ CAPS8 is not what internet was made for . Also , peoples lives and reputations have been ruined by computors . Cyber bullying is spreading like wildfire . it is anonymous , and can be detrimental to the lives of others . Internet videos of people acting like idiots never go away . There is one video of a college guy playing with a golf hall retriever like asword called @ CAPS9 kid . The video has been viewed over @ NUM1 million times . The guy in the video was made fun of for years , sued the people who put the tape online , and was forced into depression . Moving on , people can literally get their lives taken away with computors too . Identity and credit card theft is becoming more and more common . Even my dad had is credit card account stolen last year . Computors must help , but they can hurt much more .

Now a days , people are even loosing human interaction from these marvelous toys . And finally , computers are very expensive electronics , they have much up keep which costs you money ultimately making you depressed . As you can see , although there are some great pros to computers , there are also pretty big downfalls that you havn ' t thought of yet .

We must act quick , I do not know what will happen next . Finally , computer cost a lot of money . You pay @ MONEY1 for the computer outright , but then you have all the up keep and there is lots of up keep . Computers are very troublesome . You just keep pouring money into it , which is just depressing . It will just break again soon or freeze and cause you to loose a report you have worked on all night .

However , I feel that more often they negatively impact the general public . For one , there are many sites out there that portray false information . Plus , computers begin to consume the rest of peoples ' lives . When it comes to these technological devices there are pros but there the cons can easily outweigh them . To start , computers are loaded with viruses , scams and internet predators . So easily someone can steal credit and information by placing offers that seem "" too good to be true .

When my friends and I were learning about evaluating websites in computer processing class we came upon a site that seemed reliable , and accurate .

I strongly feel that sites like these and many others have a negative impact on the public . in addition , computers steal much of peoples ' time to the point where family , ' doing homework and exercising is limited . I can understand the effects of too much exposure to computers because I see it everyday with my younger brother . Once he begins his video interactive games , homework is pushed a side . The only words from his mouth are , "" @ CAPS5 , just one more game ! "" I suppose you can infer how this turns out : one game , turns two and so on . It is not only children either . Many of my own friends are update status or pictures on @ CAPS6 for three hours every night . is not their a point where we can draw the line . between going on for ten minutes and letting the computer control your life ? When surveyed ; the majority of students said that they spent at least two hours on the computer every night . When games and instant messaging starts to take away from studying and exercise there is a huge issue . Computers take away peoples ' free time and can negatively impact their grades and fitness . So , I ask you to consider the benefits of computers ; but also look for the negative effects . You will realize that their are more than you would believe . Support me on this by limiting usage of computers and by helping the public see the dangers that these technological devices @ MONTH1 bring .

Computers help use in many ways but the @ NUM1 main reasons are they help us store important documents get better at or learn forein language and get information . So without further adue here is more extensive reasonings . First of all , computers help us store many documents without computers companies that involve autioning and many other thing would have to store everything in filing cabinets . That would take forever and there would not be enough room , so a lot of files would @ CAPS1 be laying around every where @ CAPS1 think about it . You use computers to make store send your newpaper articles and without computers you would not be able to keep everybody up to date . Secondly they help use learn on get better at forien languages . Computers help use learn what other people are saying in other countries around the world . Like I have grandmother she the learned spanish . Now I can talk to her and she can understand me . Finally computers help use get information . They help us get information for a project at school , records direction , etc . In the year @ DATE1 people din ' t have computers but when the first router was made the people I went up @ NUM2 points . Farmers became slaves became very rich and I kid even grad collage at age @ NUM3 .

Who would disagree that computers are devoted to educational purposes ? Computer experts have invented countless programs that make @ ORGANIZATION1 easier for kids . For example , @ CAPS1 helps you with essays and reports .

I do not think I could have written such a great research paper without the use of a computer . The internet has many helpful sources ; such as databases , encyclopedias , and articles .

Do you always think about vulgar , inappropriate pictures , and illegal images ? that is funny , because @ CAPS3 keeps family in touch , gives people things to do , and keeps friends in different states on the same server .

My family casts actors for shows , and one way they know what an actor is capable of is by going to their channel and looking at the videos that they have created . My mother actually contacts actors in videos to see if they want to become professionals . That is the business , finding talent where it is seldom found .

9731,1703,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 , The effects computers have on people can be hurting our society or it can also be helping society . As a middle schoolers growing up , I believe using computers can be beneficial at same point but it is also damaging our society . First of all , the internet is full of innapproprate content . Illegal uses are involved and can draw in anyone with just s single click of a mouse . Anyone in the world can use the technology we have today to "" hack "" or tresspass someone else ' s computer . Anybody can download songs or documents illegally for free , rather than paying for it themselves . In fact , not only can someone download innapropriate content right onto their screen , they can also be inflicted upon with graphic words or view a website that involves videos with drug use . criminal acts , vulgar language and more . A recent study on internet use from the @ ORGANIZATION1 for internet use includes that "" @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 "" has a history of a result to suicides or depression in teens . @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 is a form of @ CAPS5 where someone can chat or instant message someone and hurt their feelings . Not only is @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 an issue , however , people can now talk to strangers on the internet . Think about how awful it would be if your child had given out their private information online and a man who said they were the same age as your child received it and lied about their age , sex , apperance , and age . Now that man can track your child down and possibly kidnap or hurt them . Secondly , the internet can also be very unhealthy and can create you to become less social . According to @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 at @ ORGANIZATION2 , @ PERCENT1 of children or teenagers that result to internet use can create a weak relationship with friends and family members if they use the computer too much . It can be very unhealthy for someone , and not just teenagers , to use the computer for an extended amount of time than they should . People can gain the effects of laziness , little brain effort , and lose interaction with the outside world . Finally , my foremost reason on how computers can be negative is how addicting it can be . From my own experience , I used to stay up late for hours using websites such as @ CAPS9 because everyone else was using it . Sure , it can be entertaining and fun but using the internet will not be so much "" fun "" when your academic grades are at risk and you stop communicating with the outside world . Adiction can draw anyone in against their willpower . My own brother became so addicted to computer games that he played one game straight for @ NUM1 hours straight . You can get addicted to one subject until you lose everything else you have . The internet can be great in moderation , however it can be innappropriate , unhealthy , and addicting .

9734,93,1,"Readers of "" @ LOCATION2 @ CAPS1 "" should be we will informed of the benifets of computers to society . Not only do they teach hand - eye coordination , but they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and provide a means to easy , online communication . In this day and age , good coordination is esencial to prospering in society . Using computers provides a method of both establishing and improving hand - eye coordination from the comfort of your own household or workplace . Dr . @ DR1 , of @ ORGANIZATION1 medical center , says that a recent study shows @ NUM1 out of every @ NUM2 computers users have better hand - eye coordination than people who do not operate on a computer regularly . In a local primary school , students have begun to "" @ CAPS2 to learn "" , a program that promotes quick typing . School officials have seen a dramatic increase in the typing speed of children since the program was started in @ DATE1 . In this way , the computer provides a secure route to better hand - eye coordination . Even more importantly , the hand - eye coordination gained from using a computer can increase the chances of getting a job involving computer hand - eye coordination as an adult such as the position of a secretary or grafic designer . While hand - eye coordination is a factor of computers that has an extremely positive effect on people , the ability to learn about distant places with the touch of a keyboard is even more benificial towards all users . Website such as google and yahoo can track down millions of results in a matter of seconds if you search the name of a city or country . This can be handy when working on school projects as we will ; instead of having to lug tens of books home to finish an essay on @ LOCATION1 , you can simply look up the information on a computer at your house . When summertime comes around , and the last school bell rings , you can instead research faraway places that could turn into vacation spots instead of homework assignments . All of the travel information from plane tickets to the right currency is at your fingertips on a computer . If "" @ LOCATION2 @ CAPS1 "" readers were aware of this , lots of trouble would be prevented and lots of time would be saved . The one component of computers that is used even more than research is online communication . State officials , governers , and even the president can post messages on websites for citizens to view while they check the weather or their email . This is a much easier way to hear goverment statements than waiting through endless commercials to hear speeches on the @ CAPS4 . Social networking sites are also immensly popular , and on pages like facebook and twitter you can reconnect with people who you do not have the chance to see everyday , or do not lie relative vincinity . If your cousin is going to school abroad , and did not have access to an international phone , you could communicate with them through email on the computer , and it would be as if they never left . It is ridiculous to think that someone could find computers - the gateway to faraway places , good hand - eye coordination , and the connection ten distant friends and family - a concern to society . They help town in countless ways and "" @ CAPS5 @ CAPS1 "" readers should be aware of this .",11.0,282,4.388170601291162,23.869565217391305,23,0.5127272727272727,6.0,1.6981818181818182,0.997626791896466,0.030909090909090914,23.0
9735,431,1,"Dear officials at the @ ORGANIZATION1 , have you ever been so bored that you spent the whole day on the computer talking to friends and relatives ? Some experts are saying that computers are having a negative effect on people in our society . While others argue that they are very helpful . the use of computers has been taken to an extreme level , and is having a negative effect on the community . Some reasons I feel this way are because of the social limit computors are putting on people and the amount of time people spend on them . My last reason is that computers are the general health of people today . People should be educated on the negative effects computers bring ! Firstly , computers are greatly changing the way people communicate . Instead of talking to people communicate . Instead of talking to people face - to - face , teenagers and adults find themselves ' @ CAPS1 "" or "" @ CAPS2 "" their friends and colleges . This is causing many bad - habit forming . People are it more to talk to physically , and might even be using terms like "" @ CAPS3 "" and "" @ CAPS4 "" instead of works . This problem is causing a huge gap in the social - wonangs of humans , and is harming them more know ! Secondly , the amount of time wasted on the computer is unbelieveable ! If someone logged onto the computer to search a fact or "" @ CAPS5 "" something , they might get caught up in other programs and spend hours on the computor . This time could have been used for more productive things instead . A recent polls shows that that average person from ages @ NUM1 spreads over two hours on the computer each day ! This fact is quite amazing , because these people could have been getting more things accomplished in this time . The amount of time wastedon computers is a huge problem that needs to change ! Lastly , humans ' health is being affected drastically by the use or computers . As the obesity rate is rising , these people are just sitting on their computors watching it go up . During this time , they could be exercising , going to the gym , or even taking a walk with friends . Teenagers could be playing outdoors , but find themselves too busy on their computors to enjoy the fresh air . Whenever I talk to my friends , they usually say they are on facebook or oovoo instead of outside or playing with their siblings . The obesity rate will keep rising if these people do not realize that staying on computers all day long is a part of the problem ! In conclusion , the use of computers has gotten to a point where it is hurting society , rather than it I feel this way because of the social - flow it is teaching people , and the amount of time wasted on computers . Another major reason is because of the extreme health issues computers are . If the average person tried ! to limit the time they use their computers , they would notice a positive in their life - style !",11.0,228,4.717399278668512,16.862068965517242,29,0.4653061224489796,6.0,1.6428571428571428,1.3914525464040957,0.018367346938775512,29.0

The computer is very advanced and helps people in many different ways , such as : hand - eye cordination , learning and being able to talk online . These things benefit society and prove the advancement in technology . The computer teaches hand - eye cordination when people do not even realize @ CAPS5 , through typing whether typing an email or an essay your hands are working and helping you . The hand - eye cordination that people learn on a computer can be used for sports . @ PERSON3 , a @ NUM1 years old tennis player , said , "" I used to go on the computer everyday and play tennis later , and eventually the computer helped use with my favorite sport . "" Hand - eye cordination is very useful , for many things our surveyed @ NUM2 people and @ NUM3 of these people say that hand - eye cordination is a very important still and that everyday activities , such as computers , help them improve . Typing is very comonly used while sending emails because they are fast , fun , and let you comunicate . When talking on a computer there are many new ways that are popular and fast , such as email welcoms aim , facebook and many more . @ CAPS5 is nice to be able to talk to friends and family online because other options are more expensive . For example , many live on @ LOCATION1 and her sister , @ PERSON4 , she is very close to , lives in @ LOCATION3 . They can not talk to each other a lot because neither of their calling plans allow them to call without charging hundreds of more money . They also can not fly to use each other because plane tickets are expensive these days . Also , the economy is not doing that great , so they could not stay in - touch until webcams come out . Now , they see each other almost every week . Many said , "" I was considering flying to @ LOCATION3 , but now the webcams and email are useful and save us both a lot of money .

Even though computers are great for fun , working and learning are much easier online .

Computers have had such a negative impact it makes people want to stay glued to their chairs with their eyes glued to their monitors . Yes computers have had a lot to do with a lot of technical advances , but at what cost do these technological advances come ? Many kids are becoming obese and lack my motivation to come out of their room off of the computer . Computers are making society very lazy this is why they have a negative impact on us . Computers have also made society lack motivation to go and exercise . A very close family friend was very obese . She was lazy and never wanted to exercise . Instead of going out and doing something about it , she stayed in her room on facebook for weeks at a time . Though the computer was not the one who made her obese , it was used as a much to hide behind the real problems . It is sad when @ PERCENT2 of teenagers say they would rather stay inside on myspace than going outside for a jogg .

I know that I would rather help the elemntry school across the street build a new garden rather than stay inside on twitter . If you are inside searching the web how will you know if the old lady across the street needs help with her groceries ? Helping around your community lets people know you care about what is going on . So do not let the computer have another second of your time . Computers have had a negative impact on society . Teenagers as we will as adults have become very lazy . They lack motivation to exercise as we will as help around the community .

9744,1320,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 of the @ LOCATION1 , @ CAPS2 , a majority of the @ ORGANIZATION1 population will use any type of computer at least once a day . Our society has been around computers so often that some peole will find it hard to even live without them . Computers have become something that people depend on . This , however , is something to take as a concern . when people are dependent on computers too much , they loose valuble skills that the once possesed and they spend less time , outside exercising while also loossing touch with famly and friends . It has become near that computers have become along part of peoples lives . Computers posses the ability to do certain human tasks that seem hard for us to do . Before the computer age , it was a lot more difficult to find information on a topic or place . We used to have to use encyclopedias or find books on those topics . Sometimes we would even have to travel to a place and learn about it . Today , however , people use technology to find this information . You @ MONTH1 be thinking , "" @ CAPS3 , how is this a bad thing ? "" . The reason it is a problem is because people have begun to loose the ability to use books like encylopedias and atleses or even simmple maps . Once , most of the population could use these tools to help find their way through information or a place . I know from experienc , that I can barley look at a map and find where I am . We have become too dependent on @ CAPS4 ' s and computers , which in turn makes us forget valuble information . What would happen if someone got lost and they did not have a working @ CAPS4 or signal on their phones . They would get lost and not know how to read a map . As you can see the human population has because too dependent on computers . Additionally , people all around the world have become addicted to the internet . Facebook , @ CAPS6 and even @ CAPS7 baseball have become an addicting activity that people consume all of their time with . When people begin to spend hte majority of their time on these websites , they will in turn get less excersise , and become more distant from family and friends . Mostly teenagers have this problem . If you took a survay of the number of students who have a facebook account or @ CAPS6 , you would probably get the majority . Having an account like this is said to be addicting . Students , parents and everyone in between will find troubles later on because of this . America is one of the leading nations with obesity . Has anyone stopped to think that maybe people spend too much time on these websites to get any excersise ? If the internet was not such a big thing it is now , I bet you there would be less overweight people . but not only do people become overweight , they will end up more and more distant from family and friends . My own sister spends so much time on her laptop that my parents had to take it away . Once , the only way for us to really talk to her through facebook . As you can see , computers can be a dangerous thing . think of all the people who you know that spend multiple hours on the computer . You can probably thnks of quiet a few . Computers are an addicting thing that can cause less excersising and less communication which is proven to support a healthy life style . Also when people use computers too much , they loose valueble skills . Remember this next time you are someone you know sits down at a computer for a long time .

9745,383,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 you think computers are good for providing us with useful information ? I @ CAPS2 . This is only one of the reasons why I agree with the use of computers . The reasons are : They provide us with information for learning , they allow us to communicate with people , and they provide entertanment . However , I @ CAPS2 understand why someone would oppose than . Let me explain my point of view . Whenever I need to @ CAPS2 or know something that I do not know about , I go to my computer and look it up . Many seach engines such as @ ORGANIZATION1 , @ CAPS3 and @ LOCATION1 allow us to input a question or phase and gives us links to other websites that hold information about the topic we are trying to learn about . Another way computers help us learn is because we can download and install software that help us with things like learning a forgian language or even just practicing math . For example , my grandfather wanted to learn how to speak @ CAPS4 but he did not have time to go to classes . So he ordered a program that teaches him how to speak @ CAPS4 while he is home . Another reason why I think that computers benifit society is because it allows us to communicate with other people . One way is through social sites where you have a profile and you can "" chat "" with your friends by typing in what you want to say . Another way is through video chat . This is when you have a webcam and you can see and talk to other people . I think that this is very important because @ PERCENT1 of people that the computers leads people to become "" anti - social "" . It also helps you connect with old school friends and relatives that are far away .

This is yet another reason how computers can benefit us . If you are going somewhere that you think your kids will be bored all you have to @ CAPS2 ( if you have laptop ) is put a movie in for them to watch . Another way that computer provide entertainment is they let us listen to music . If you have an ipod or @ NUM1 player you can download the music from the computer . It also provides us with entertainment if we are interested in playing video games . There is entertainment for everyone . Even though I support the use of computers I understand the negitive effect they have on many people . Some of those things are : people stop excersiceing and become over weight , they @ MONTH1 become less interactive with other people , and they @ MONTH1 not spend as much time in the fresh air .

9748,916,1,"Dear @ LOCATION2 , @ CAPS1 ' s the dillemant @ CAPS2 that people are supporting computer technology and others are not . I firmly believe that having computers generally has a positive effect . This is because many jobs are using them everyday and it is very efficiant for them . Also , having computers allows people to connect with other people , edit things that other technology cannot , and play fun games , @ CAPS3 effect that computers have is educational websites ; games , and articals . This helps many kids find a good education and adults find a comfortable and happy job . Primarily . computers have a positive effect on people because jobs are using them frequently . Jobs such as @ ORGANIZATION1 and any type of police work provide sarely for people all around the united states and other parts of the world . My father always told me , "" Computers save people everyday "" . Even schools use computers ! They provide educational information about the students in schools , and my school , @ LOCATION1 school , uses them quite often . For example , I see my teacherm . Mr , @ CAPS4 his computer every single movning in homeroom . Nearly @ PERCENT1 of all jobs involve a computer by storing information or any other purposed fealuired . Would you want all those people to lose ther job because of their skills and techniques towards computer technology ? I know I would not , @ CAPS5 keep in mind computers provide a safe and healthy life for many people . In addition , computers have a positive effect on people because they can do many things that nothing else can do . This is things like staying in town with someone far away , or editing photos . Even playing a game on the computer could ne relaxing to almost anyone . @ CAPS6 is an example of keeping in town with someone else . For me , @ CAPS6 is a life - saver . It allowed me to talk to my brother white he was at his chaotic college . In fact , nearly @ PERCENT2 of people have an account on a computer of a public website live @ CAPS7 , @ CAPS6 , or @ CAPS9 . Computers keep photos saved that can be edited and even just saved to be admired . I do not want my pictures and my @ CAPS6 deleted because nothing else competes with the mighty computer since it me have an enjoyable time and entertains me we will . Thirdly , computers have a positive effect on people because they give aduts and kids tree access to education . I remenber my old elementery school used to play many amusing math games . These were @ CAPS5 my education grew greatly dae to this game . Games as these are used frecquently thoughout the world . In addition jobs have been lost from this had economy . However , jobs we hering found more and more everyday from adults trying to find a decent job online . Computer saved people from losing their house because of the money they made with the help of computers , computers are a good idea To conclude . I imploor you that computer technology has a strong positive effect on people . Computers are like a pencil to a student . for they are very important .

We also would not have the ability to do reseach for school online and running a business would be even more difficult . Without computers our society would not be so far advanced . Being social is an important quality in life . the main way of being social these days , other than texting , is to chat online with friends . Facebook , @ CAPS3 , @ CAPS4 , and skype all give their users the ability to make new friends , find long lost friends , and chat with friends . I personally have a skype and facabook , and I am able to access them everyday . Without them , I would not be able to chat with friends out of school except for sports and texting . Everyday I workout and lift weights and go on facebook , that is why that whole statement , "" spending less time exercising , and more time on the computer "" is false . Facebook and skype are a past of my everyday life and without them I know I would not be as social . Computers are also a part of my everyday life , because I have to use it to do research for school or typing up an @ CAPS5 paper . As you have now seen , my handwriting is not so great , so I end up typing a lot of my homework because of it . Without computers my teachers would not be able to read my work . Computers also help with making graphs and data tables for science lab reports . Without a computer the graphs would have to be handmade , which is not as presentable . Overall computers are used everyday in school to either do research or to type up some homework . Education plays a key role in society and if we did not use computers out education that we would receive would not be the same as it is now . My last reason why i believe that computers play a positive role in society is that computers are what keeps businesses running . Without computers some businesses would be unable to function , and those could function , would be awful slow . Since our society is so far advanced our businesses need computers in order to complete the jobs . Expenses and income are saved to businesses computers , if that was all done an paper they could be lost or ruined .

Later , you come back to the laptop to find that your paper is not there anymore ! You look all over your folders ; but it is gone . Computers always have technical glitenes , but you don ' ' t always have time to go to the tech help store to fix it . However , if you had written out the paper , it would not have randomly disappeared ! @ CAPS4 people depend on computers too much , it can backfire and cause a @ CAPS3 problem for you . My sixth grade teachers once said , "" @ CAPS4 I was in college , I had a big french paper due . I worked hard all night to get it done . Then , @ CAPS4 I went back to print it , it had been erased . I had to rewrite the whole thing again ! "" Computers have a big negative effect on society because we tend to depend on them too much . In conclusion , computers are hurting our society , clearly , they are unhealthy for our bodies . Also , the information on the computers internet might be naccurate . Lastly , we rely on computers too much , which leads to problems . I strongly believe we should recluce our dependence on computers !",11.0,248,5.1059526266969595,13.91891891891892,37,0.4806201550387597,6.0,1.6976744186046508,1.4141566206100542,0.02325581395348837,37.0
9752,1590,1,"Dear Local @ CAPS1 : I am sitting at the couch thinking about what I should do for vacation . I know I definitely want to take a trip somewhere to do same creative writing , but my notebooks are all scattered , I do not know how to quickly contact someone who could help and I have no idea about the country that I plan to visit . I take a last look at my notebooks strewn about the closet looking very much like a tornado swept through and I find solution on the highest shelf my laptop . First , I highly agree with the people who think computers are useful . Three effects they have on people who use them usely are fantastic . Compare a person with a laptop to one without . The person with a laptop @ MONTH1 be a busy business person and have to converse with many people from long distances a part , so they use e ' mail and @ ORGANIZATION1 . They travel places with people at their fingertips . However a person without a laptop could be busy moving from place to place just to meet these people . Their schedule could be chaotic . Conversations over a chat system are fast and effective . Take my story for example . My mom hates wasting , so instead of me driving to a friend we @ CAPS2 . Saves money and time ! In addition , I happen to be a writer who write often everyday in many notebooks . I had written so much over the years that my notebooks are piling all over my room . What organizational tool could help me in this situation ? Why a laptop of course ! One laptop or computer store a bunch of and editing a breeze . Anyone who with data and writing would be crazy not to have a computer ! What you a room notebooks that you buy of , or a single , computer with tons of space and back up ? You tell me . Computers encourage users to be more organized ! Respectively , computers are resource for a millions of pages information . they are similar to libraries . But think about a library and then imagine a computer . One you have to walk around to seek your information and with the other , knowledge is merely a click away . Some @ MONTH1 argue that computer websites are not entirely reliable I beg to differ . There are specific websites on computers with suffixes like ' . org ' and ' . gov ' and even ' . edu ' . These websites contain proven factual information and more great resources for research . By using computers I have acquired greater knowledge and have found computers beneficial . They have effectively made me more intellgent as a person . In conclusion , it is my strong opinion that those who use computers gain nothing but the positive effects , and these include money / gas - saving conversations through @ CAPS2 and email organization and increased intelligence from reading . I had decide to take my creative writing on my laptop and in doing so learned the storm .",11.0,255,4.874000694353889,13.08108108108108,37,0.5257731958762887,6.0,1.6907216494845358,1.6840868278519971,0.012371134020618556,37.0
9753,1022,1,"Dear Local Newspaper : Are computers possitively affecting society ? As technology advances , humans are relying on them more and more ; most people use them daily . I believe computers effect people possitively because they help write papers , are a social tool , and are a big help with research . After reading this letter there will be no doubt that computers have a possitive effect on people in society . My first reason why computers have a possitive effect on people is they help with writing papers . Whether it is writing a resume , a science report , or a spreadsheet , none of these are ever seen nowadays done by hand . Everyone expects to see the flawlessly inked letters on the printer paper in whatever piece of writing it is . This helps the people writing the paper because writing takes many drafts to get the piece perfect ; it is a pain to write each draft by hand . In additio , it is easier to read someone ' s writing @ CAPS1 it is typed , especially @ CAPS1 the writer has hand writing . However , computers help in more than just writing papers . My second reason why computers passitively effect people is by being a social tool . Many websites online these days have social networks such as youtube , facebook , twitter , and myspace . In the listed websites above and many others as we will , people can meet other people through other friends and games . The nice thing about meeting them online is that you do not have to plan a time to meet the person , @ CAPS1 you are both online you guys can begin chatting . The chatting also helps @ CAPS1 people have long - distance relationships , whether friends , mates , or family . Online chatting help people stay in - touch with someone they might not see everyday . That is a big help with everyone ' s social life , keeping then us "" the "" @ CAPS2 , online sites like eharmony or match . com take people with little time to worry about love and match them with their perfect mate . This also helps people who are shy get married and start a family . This helps people live happier lives , another possitive effect . Finally , computers possitively effect people by making research much easier . My dad always says "" You kids got it easy . @ CAPS1 I was growing up , we should to go to the library and spend hours researching before we could write our papers . "" @ CAPS3 , it is simple . Using the internet and a search engine , all you have to do is type a topic and you can get all the latest articles in just seconds . Libraries might not have the most recent books , or someone might have checked out your topic ' s book . Then what can you do ? The internet is also an extremely useful help @ CAPS1 the research topic is very specific , if it is a certain becteria or species that a book @ MONTH1 only briefly mention . The internet has a much broader range of articles , so it is much easier to find information for any topic . With research , taking less time to understand , people can spend more time enjoying the day , like playing outside , than in the library stressing because they cannot find a book on their topic . This is a strong reason why computers should not be seen as a negative effect on society . To conclude , computers have a possitive effect on society , because they help write papers , they are a social tool , and are a big help with research . Where would we be if we had to handwrite everything ? Think about how many fewer friends or maybe even relationships we would have without social websites . What about how hours of research are @ CAPS3 two clicks away ? Computers have changed our lives for the better , and we should appreciate all the do for us .",11.0,280,5.045955727595311,17.333333333333332,36,0.44799999999999995,6.0,1.6464,1.3005037310049536,0.0144,36.0
9754,875,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , The use of computer benefits society due to the possitive affect on people . Such as good hand - eye coordination , ability to learn about far away places and people as we will as being able to talk online with family and friends . Did you know that teenagers who use computers often when compared to those who do not , have increased test scores ? This is because they are able to look so definitions faster , research and learn about anything they need at their fingertips . Furthermore , families and friends that live across the country are able to keep in touch due to email , video chats and facebook . It is fascinating to realize that use of the computer can increase your hand eye coordination . You are probably wandering how this is and think that I am insane but there are legitimate reasons . Since I play basketball , volleyball and softball , hand eye coordination is extremely important . One cold , wintery @ DATE1 @ TIME1 . I was working on a long history paper and @ CAPS1 essay , which meant countless hours on the computer typing . At five o ' clock off I went to my basketball grow , @ CAPS2 the best game of my life was playerl . Then , a week later , we had another game but this time I went straight from church . Consequently , I did not play as we will ; missed a lot of passes and shots . This proved to me that things use of computers , my hand - eye coordination improved . Can you imagine being able to learn about people in faraway places , their cultures , ethicities and relgion ? we will now this is more than possible through the advances in technology . In history , we were doing research on the world hunger crisis in our allied countries . Through the knowledge of this hunger , I was able to start a fundraiser at my church . @ PERSON1 ; @ CAPS2 teenagers like myself do not eat for @ NUM1 hours . Research has proven that @ NUM2 children in countries of africa die a day from malnurutousment . Now that this has been brought to my attention , I am going to work four hours a day to give these innocent children even a portion of what I consume . Thus through the use of computers I was able to learn about the pain those children suffer and now it is my . Do you have family that is across the country that you are rarely able to see ? My aunt and uncle live in @ LOCATION3 and they were just blessed with a beautiful baby boy , @ LOCATION4 . Since we are only graced with their presenced about once a year we begin to miss them . But now through skype , email and facebook , we are able to stay updated on the success and growth of @ LOCATION4 as we will as @ CAPS2 they have recently traveled to . Also @ PERCENT1 as the teenage population in the @ CAPS3 . S spend at least four hours a day @ CAPS4 , tweeting or using facebook to stay in touch with their friends . Recently , I have moved from @ LOCATION2 to @ LOCATION1 and staying in contact with my fr iends there is extremely important to me . Those are the people that I grew up with and have known since birth . The use of computers has allowed me to stay in contact with distant friends and relatives . To conclude , due to improved hand - eye coordination , ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to communicate online , with other people the use of computers benefits society . Through the internet , people can learn about @ LOCATION2 places to travel bike and exercise while enjoying nature . Furthermore , when family and friends want to spend time together , they need to plan the logistics of it and without email and being online this becomes nearly impossible . I appreciate you taking the time to read this and hopefully you will take my opinion into consideration when debating over the topic of computer .",11.0,306,5.051181857267396,18.428571428571427,35,0.4736842105263158,6.0,1.6393188854489165,1.1488835401005122,0.032507739938080496,35.0
9755,92,1,"Dear local Newspaper ; @ CAPS1 you know that computers teach you to do many things ? You probably do ! I understand you would like to know my opinion on whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people . we will , I think that it has a positive effect . Computers teach you how to type and learn the moun keys . It also helps you to look things up like people , states , and etc . Lastly , it helps you to interact with other students when not in school . i encourage you to continue reading to hear my wonderful and strategic ideas . First of all , I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the learning skills to learn how to type I remember last year in @ NUM1 grade , the tech ed teacher , ma @ LOCATION4 , told to go on a website that was all about learning how to type . It told us that the main keys were . A , @ CAPS2 , @ CAPS3 , @ CAPS4 and @ CAPS5 , @ CAPS6 , @ CAPS7 , and colon ( ; ) . It was very helpful . From then on I typed like that . I think that learning how to type is an excellent thing . Typing helps you if you want to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor . My mother is a secretary down town at the low form called : @ ORGANIZATION1 . She works for three houses so she learned to type really fast . Typing is a big part of your life . You can use it for a project that you have to do for class , or an essay lthat you have to type to apply for a scholarship ro colege . Typing is used everywhere , even in math class my teacher types up things and pits them on the @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 . In addition , computers have a positive affect on people because they help look up famous people , states , countries , and etc . I remember on @ NUM2 grade I @ CAPS1 a project on @ CAPS10 , and in @ NUM3 grade I @ CAPS1 a powerpoint on I had also done a project on @ LOCATION1 in @ NUM1 grade , I @ CAPS1 one on @ PERSON1 this year for music , and I am beginning one on @ LOCATION2 and @ LOCATION3 . As you can tell , I had been using a computer , basically my whole life , except when I was a baby , but now that I think about it , when @ CAPS11 a baby I got a little fake computer . i know computers are @ LOCATION1 but they do have a positive effect on people . When was the last time you need a computer to help you look up something or someone ? Priority not too long ago . Computers are the real dael . They can help you do anything . they have helped me my whole life . To be continued , computers have a positive effect on people . They help interact with other people students , and fa mily members , when not in contact . I remember when my cousin moved away . i was so sad . I did not went her to leave . So then she gave me her email to contact her on the computer so I could talk to her . The computer has many websites where people can interact like : @ CAPS12 , @ CAPS14 , @ CAPS13 , aol , msn , yahoo , g - mail , twitter , and many more . i like talking to people from all over the country . I talk to my friend when I am at home . i talk to family members . My favorite website is @ CAPS14 . I am a fanatic of it . It ' @ CAPS2 spo much fun . Do you have a favorite interaction website ? @ CAPS1 you have any interaction websites ? If you do not you should get one . This is why computers have a positive effect on people . In conclusion , i think that computers have a positive effect on people . One because they can interact with others . Two : they can look up things to help them . Three , they can develop a sense of typing . Thank you for reading my letter which I am sure has persuaded you to agree with me on how computers have a positive effect on people .",11.0,278,5.337119570055734,13.058823529411766,51,0.41679160419790107,5.0,1.538230884557721,1.5351109019951743,0.04197901049475263,51.0

They give people the opportunity to look at things & talk to that it traveled here they wallets empty faster than the speed of it . @ CAPS2 also have the ability to help people so things that an than a pig sty . Let me explain more these reasons . Computers are very good for our society because they are kids in tracking hand - eye coordination to kids & adults . Just to help you understand why in to teach hand - eye coordination , @ CAPS2 are so many that help you learn but help you learn will get you . In foot ball catching helps to teach the skill but makes you up on the ground after being by someone potentially yourself . In baseball swinging at a pitch to teach his skill , but if the is very close to you it could how you for the if you do the ball could someone & hurt them , ability to day back .

9760,1299,1,"Dear @ PERSON2 , Have you ever noticed how different our society is today , even from just ten years ago ? that is because of computers . Yes , it is true that computer give us advantages like messaging and information , but they also take away from some of the greater aspects of life : staying fit , enjoying nature , and spending time with family and friends . Without those , life would be horribly unbeneficial . While surfing the web @ MONTH1 be fun , it has been proven unhealthy . "" if a person was to spend more than two and a half hours on the computer every @ TIME1 for about a month they would see a sudden increase in their gain . And if they kept the behavior up , they could gain up to one third their initial body weight until medical help was provided , "" say @ PERSON3 , a specialist in obesity at @ ORGANIZATION1 . Also , @ PERCENT1 of all computer users snack while online , which only increases weight gain even more . Unfortunately those that spend alot of time on the computer are not usually okay with exercising either . Instead of outing down just a half an hour out of their computer time to play with the dog , take a jog , or try some aerobics , computer lovers usually just stay in front of the screen . that is too bad , because it causes health problems for them and maybe even the generations after them . Nature , is being ignored @ CAPS1 , more than ever . @ PERSON1 can recall the time when the trails @ CAPS2 runs were overrun with people . "" @ CAPS1 "" @ CAPS2 says "" they are being overrun with woods and . Those are harder to act rid of that people . "" But it is live , the trails and that to be fuller nature lovers are numbers . Because of today ' s new technologies , especially computers , the beauty of nature is being almost completely passed by . Some worry if it will fade entirely and instead of trying to maintain what is left , we will just let it do so . Hopefully though , the next generation of people will reconize this horrible mistakes . Doctors , @ CAPS3 , all people alike are seeing more and more how computers affect family life . How often do you eat dinner with the whole family . When you do not , where are you most of the time ? At the computer ? that is what I thought . When computers and other technologies are available there is much less of a chance that you will actually interact with family and friends . mrs @ PERSON4 , an @ NUM1 grade teacher in @ LOCATION1 , noticed that her family spent less time together than ever before when each family member got a laptop . @ CAPS2 believes this is pulling her family apart . Do you ? As you can conclude , computers have an awful influence , on society : people do not take , the time to stay fit , nature is being completely ignored , and Family interaction rates are poor . Whaat can we do to fix this problem ? Just set a little time aside daily to observe these aspects of life . This way , life with computers will be beneficial after all .",11.0,273,4.746271633281727,15.6875,32,0.5427435387673957,6.0,1.658051689860835,1.5612781244591325,0.03180914512922465,32.0

People would need to travel to visit a library to research , every document , doctors notes , and building plan would have to be written by hand or on an old typewriter . Life would have been much more difficult . Today , computers allow us to communicate with one another , access the millions of websites on the internet and help with school work . Almost everyday , my mon and dad receive friend requests from long lost school friends as we will as relatives and current friends . Today ' s computers allow the world to talk to one another and know what is going on . My dad always says "" @ CAPS2 makes the world go round . "" With the social networking sites , everyone is receiving tons of @ CAPS2 about one another . Another way to communicate is by video chat . All @ CAPS3 computers are equipped with a video camera and you can buy one if you have a @ CAPS4 . This will let you see the person ' s face are talking to . I have heard many amazing stories about this . One is about a soldier in @ LOCATION1 and his present wife back home . The doctors set up a computer equipped with video chat in the operating room and the soldier was , in a way , in two places at once . The man got to see his newborn baby and his wife . Computers can do amazing things ! Another reason computers are great is their accessability to the internet . There is this cool website called @ CAPS5 . Dcotors . Com . If you have an illness or a symtom to something , all you have to do is type it in on the home page and it will list all the possible reasons or outcomes . It also tells you how to treat it and where to find the medicine . If we looked back in time , one would need to travel to a doctor and pay to have your problem checked out . Also computers help out immensely with school work and homework . Many teachers nowadays request or demand students to type their asignments because it is easy to read , and it is easier to correct . I also find it faster to type then print . Say that you need to research the periodic table and write down @ NUM1 facts as we will as all the elements . There are probably hundreds if not thousands of websites on this subject . All you need to do is type it in on google . You can also add an image by copy and pasting ; which will inhance your work . Computers have helped students and teachers . Lastyly , computers ( and tehn keyboards ) are helping people with hand - eye coordination . Many schools are offering typing classes to try and help students . I recently searched this topic on the internet and it showed a study done by @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 that people who practice typing at least @ NUM2 minutes a day , will experience increased hand - eye coordination to @ PERCENT1 better . This increase would help many , people with low coordination . Today , computers are helping the world in many ways .

You should be outside , enjoying the fresh air and playing sports , not stuck inside all day with your eyes glued to a screen .

Communicating with others has always been a great part of our lives . There is not a person in the world who has not had some form of communication with others .

The question then is , do computers have positive effects on people ? I strongly believe computers do benefit society . Firstly , computers teach you hand - eye coordination . The main way is by typing . When you type , you start of looking at the keys but eventually you memorize all the locations of the keys . Also , computer games teach hand - eye coordination . If you weren ' t looking at the screen , would it be possible to win the game ? When computers teach you hand - eye coordination , you can use it for other things too . For example , you definitely need it in sports or more . Specifically , baseball . If you did not have good hand - eye coordination , you would not be able to catch the ball or be able to hit the ball when you swing . Hand - eye coordination very important . Secondly , computers give people the ability to form about places and people . When people are deciding when to get vacation , they go in the internet . What there is in do . Why would you travel in a place is you back . Many use the internet in research other countries . When the eight grade did reports their information . Eighty seven percent the internet . Finally ; some people say computers take away from interaction with family and friends , but computers actually allow you to tell with other family and friends around the world . would not it be wonderful to with your loved ones in a different state of country ? The main way of online communication is @ CAPS5 - mail or @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 . These allow you to send someone a message faster and easier . It is much easier in remember someone @ CAPS5 - mail address than it is a phone settle for just talking , when you can actually see the person ? It would be like them being in the room with you . Computers are a great way to talk to someone . Why wait any longer ? Computers are a great way to refine your hand - eye coordination skills . You can research Faraway people and places to see what life is like around the globe . Most importantly , you can communicate with family and friends online through @ CAPS8 , @ CAPS5 - mail , or @ CAPS10 . Definitely , computers benefit society . So go and share this information with other people to convince them that computers are positive .",11.0,204,4.929649317293522,11.714285714285715,35,0.4963503649635037,6.0,1.673965936739659,1.365563795114052,0.021897810218978103,35.0
9769,1237,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 people think that computers are used too much , and are helping people become over weight , and even obese . This is maybe true , but computers also teach hand eye coordination , give people the oppertunity to learn about far away places , and people can even coordinate on them ! Over all I think computers effect people in a positive way , and these are some reasons why . Computers help teach hand eye coordination . I know your probably thinking "" huh ? How do computers do that ? All your doing is staring at a screen . "" But to your dismay computers do teach hand eye coordination . It does this because while playing games , people watch the screen , and click with their hands . They do not just stare at the mouse while they play these games . By doing so , it teaches hand eye coordination . Scientist have provine that people who own a computer and use it at least @ NUM1 hours a week , have better coordination that people who do not own a computer by @ PERCENT1 ! Just that statistic alone speaks a thousand words alone . Hand - eye coordination is a thing . It helps you play better in sports like baseball , and not only that but it helps future jobs . As you can tell , @ CAPS1 , without computers out hand eye coordination . People think that computers are only used for games , but in reality , they teach us @ CAPS2 things about the world . Without computers people would know about nearly anything that is going in other countries . For example , the other day , my mom was checking her email and came access the stay of a young , starving . That are story changer her anyday life because takes food for granted . Without computer my mom would have more in other countries . Because we live in the @ CAPS4 . S what is going on in other countries . Are less fortanite , but computer help remind and teach us what is going in the world everyday . One of the main advantages about computers is they allow people to communicate through them . Even my grandmother said the , without computers , I would not be as close to you as I am today . "" @ CAPS5 and my grandmother use the website skype . com . This websit allows you to not only talk to the other person , but to see them too ! Because of site like these . I am allowed to stay in contact , and be able to see my grandmother who lives faraway . Without computers this would not be possible . Not only do computers let you talk to people far away , but people close too . I often find myself asking friends over the computer , what the homework is , or when is the next test , etc . Computers make it easier to connect to people near and far . In conclusion , computers help in all different ways . The world would be upside down without them . They give people the ability to learn about far away places and people , teach hand eye coordination , and allow people to communicate with each other . Computers have @ CAPS2 flaws , but they also have so @ CAPS2 positive effects too that I think they shine over all the tiny flaws . Thank you .",11.0,235,5.107259232539205,13.025,40,0.4501915708812261,5.0,1.5862068965517242,1.7054359543217832,0.01532567049808429,40.0

I am a person who supports the advances in technology and believe computers have a positive effect on people , @ CAPS2 ran benefit people in many ways . The three most important ways to me is that @ CAPS2 helps with hand - eye coordination , gives people another source to retain knowledge from , and lastly @ CAPS2 realise to another way for people communicate . Hand - eye coordination is an awesome skill to have in our society . In a country , being the @ LOCATION2 , that revolves around sports , hand - eye coordination really helps out . Using the computers really helps harness and train your hand - eye for sports such as baseball , basketball and many more . Using the computers for hand - eye coordination will really help the @ LOCATION2 to develop some world class athletes . We also live in a country where their are so many drivers and cars on the road . We have a problem with bad drivers here in the @ LOCATION2 so if they improve their coordination maybe the numbers of car accidents and fatalities involving automobile will decreas . we will how in computers help with with hand - eye coordination yoe ask ? I will tell you how , by people using fun gaming sites , like luniosity . com , which is a website with games for brain training . @ CAPS2 helps with hand - eye coordination , concentration , memorization , and problem solving . They help your brain in all of these categories just by having cute and fun little game . As you can see in the @ LOCATION2 we need improved hand - eye coordination and @ CAPS2 could do many positive things for the country . We cam improve @ CAPS2 just by computer . To retain knowledge about other cultures , places , people and miscellaneous things makes to amazing thanks to the computer we have for this information besides books . have the internet and computers you can know about what you want when you type in the subject into a search engine like google or yahoo . People can learn all of this wonderful and interesting information about things they of never known before . @ CAPS2 also helps kids like to find information for reports and . There are truly you can learn on the internet . You can learn about or . Maybe the difference between an element and a compound , or even just the definition of the word sucess than is a to @ LOCATION1 . You can get so much knowledge from the computers / internet . Communication is another huge part of our daily lives . Most people have home phones or call phones , but for the ones who do not they need as meen of communication . On the computer you can use instant @ CAPS3 or email ; @ CAPS4 twitter , or myspace as we will . The computer gives people who do not have phones another way to communicate with others . Even if you do have a phone and someone you known is overseas . Instead of wasting money on a long distances just use one of the systems y ' ve mentioned . The same thing goes for our military , they do not have phones to call home so they communicate via the computer . Communicating via computer is just another reason why the computer is so important . So as I conclude my letter to you , the north @ CAPS1 courier , I shall restate that I do support technology because they do have positive effects on people . The positive effects that are the most major are @ CAPS2 teaches hand - eye coordinating helps people with another source to gain knowledge , and lastly @ CAPS2 allows another way to communicate with people .

9771,378,1,"Dear local Newspaper , I have heard that there is a controversy over if computers benefit our society . Based on my opinion , it has become clear to me that they have beneficial because they help us keep in contact , complete our daily work , and give everyone a fun time . If we were in a world without computers then our society would be completely lost . First off , one contributing factor is that computers help us keep in contact . Any one person can simply send an email by a click of a button . However , if this device was not around , we would have to use postal service or the telephone , both of which cost money . Why would not you want a computer ? What happens if a hurricane is abroad , and a family has no idea of it is presence ? All they need to do is check their email or the internet to realize what danger they are in . Calling somebody is risky because they could not be able to ansuer for any reason . In a situation like this , computers became essential to everyone . Clearly , the ability to contact is a great reason why computers need to be kept . Secondly , computers help us complete our daily work . Almost everyone works during the week , and if you @ MONTH1 not realize it , we get most of our help from computers . Let ' s say that a man or women is ath theiroffice and they need to create a power point in order to share the companies new brand . All he / she needs to do is turn on their computer and begin to work with a blink of an eye . But without this device , what would they be able to do ? How would they complete their work ? The need for a @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 , or laptop is obviously great when you work . Lastly , computers give us the ability to play games and browse the internet freely . When I go home , usually I go straight to my computer like most teenagers do . I can easily check scores or last nights games , listen to music , and play solitaire by myself . I do not need to turn on the @ CAPS3 and wait throve . All of these tiresome commercials . I do not need to grab a @ CAPS4 and throw it into a boombox . I do not need to grab all the playing carols and set a game up . All I need is my computer . Without a doubl the fun and helpful computers such as games help us out . Although some say that computers are not needed they help us throughout our lives . Based on my opinion , it has become clear to me that they are beneficial because they help us keep in contact , complete our daily work , and give everyone a fun time . All of these facts to one final solution , which is keeping computers in our society .",11.0,217,4.8340676486461085,15.32258064516129,31,0.4558823529411765,5.0,1.5252100840336134,1.4435859418929904,0.012605042016806723,31.0

You use computers to write , play games , look at pictures , and print work out . There are dozens @ ORGANIZATION1 practical for computers but nowadays , many people , especially children , are using computers excessively . This unnecessary usage @ ORGANIZATION1 computers can cause obesity , expose children to mappropriate things & destroy family time . Readers , hear my arguement and by the end @ ORGANIZATION1 the paper you will surely agree with me that computers are detrimental to society . Have you ever made a @ ORGANIZATION2 @ CAPS1 ' s @ CAPS2 to lose weight ? it is not uncommon for one to make such a goal . According to the @ ORGANIZATION2 , @ PERCENT1 @ ORGANIZATION1 adults make their @ ORGANIZATION2 @ CAPS1 ' s @ CAPS2 to get in shape , exercise nore or just lose weight . we have all seen the commercials on @ CAPS4 that encourage you to "" @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 ! "" @ CAPS7 you too can "" lose weight in just one week "" ! There are also plenty @ ORGANIZATION1 entrepenuers out there that want to convince you to buy their exercise product @ CAPS7 you can develop outrageously large muscles in "" no time at all "" . But do all these & exercise plans really work ? According to a study done by the @ ORGANIZATION1 , the largest cause @ ORGANIZATION1 obesity is actually computers ! The students at @ LOCATION1 had one group @ ORGANIZATION1 people try a regular commercial diet plan & another group @ ORGANIZATION1 people do exactly what they have been doing . Except their computers . They found that the group who from computer use lost nearly @ PERCENT2 more weight on average them the group on the comercial diet ! Nothing is causing obesity in @ LOCATION2 them computer . A familier day for an average child in @ LOCATION2 goes like this : go to school , home on the bus , use computer eat dinner , do homework , go to bed . Unfotunately , these happens @ NUM1 days a week & the computer time is eating up none other than the exercise time . Readers please , try avoiding you computers for just one week , and you can forget those jet plane . Another negative @ ORGANIZATION1 computers is that it not only affects an individual but possildy an entire family ! Many children can go an entire day without sitting down & talking to their parents . My friend @ PERSON1 often hope from school and goes straight up to to use his laptop without even saying hello to his parents . Computers have become nearly an addiction to most teenagers . @ PERCENT3 @ ORGANIZATION1 teens in @ LOCATION2 say they use computers daily & @ PERCENT4 say they have trouble communication with their parents . There is a direct connection between the lack @ ORGANIZATION1 communication at home for teens & computer usage . Teens become in their society lives and become to their computers . What they do not notize is that they are totally forgetting about their families ! I know I had made the mistake @ ORGANIZATION1 becoming too attached to socia networking to remember my family but luckily I have a stable family environment . Some teens do not have that luxury . Computers have the ability to destroy parent - child relationships , do not let that happen to you . Your children are without a doubt , through , the ones a by this technical revolution the most . From the time they were your children probably had a keyboard at their fingertips . Do parents ever realize what they are getting their children into when they teach them how to use a computer though . Children as young as @ NUM2 or @ NUM3 years old are exposed to profamily , & vulgar pictures on the web on supposed "" safe sides "" . Do you even realize who your child ' s talking to on the computer ? With all the @ CAPS8 ' s & emails flying around , you could be talking to a complete stranger without - even knowing . An enormous part @ ORGANIZATION1 who your child become & the values they hold is a product @ ORGANIZATION1 what they were exposed to @ ORGANIZATION1 a young age . Bring a computer to your kindergartrer & you can probably guess what they will grow up with . No matter how much you think or believe on the safety @ ORGANIZATION1 computer , you cannot argue with the fact that computer expose children to adult content very early in their lives . @ CAPS7 do you look at your computer differently @ CAPS6 ? Faced with the concerns @ ORGANIZATION1 lack @ ORGANIZATION1 exercise , separation @ ORGANIZATION1 families & mappriate natural children do you really want your children , or even you for that matter , using a computer daily . Think a head @ NUM4 years from @ CAPS6 . Will you say "" I wish I used my computer "" or "" I wish I spent more time "" .

9779,585,1,"Dear Newspaper , Computers ! Computers ! Computers ! Computers seem to be the talk of the year . Many people believe that computers are needed for everyday life , but I would have to disagree . In my opinion we do not need computers . The effects computers have on kids and adults are astonishing . Humans today are not spending as much time in nature and excirsising for a healthy body and a healthy planet . Also , as us kids are growing up , we have too many advantages because of computers . Thirdly , so much money is being used towards computers and not what is truely important ! As you can see these three reasons alone should persuade anyone to believe that computers are harmful to all areas of life . First off , as we continue to use computers our natural environment is going to waste . The effects on nature and people are horrible . Polution is being spread all over the planet ! People are becoming addicted to computers . I know it will surprise you when I tell you that the average person spends about ten hours on a computer a day ! This is about half the day ! This is a terrifying effect on people , because now these computers are brain washing us ! Instead of going on the computer all day , we should be going outside to enjoy fresh air and the sun . Their the more , computers have us sitting inside all day and not getting any excirsive , which is a health issue we need to learn about the little things and be thankful for what we already have ! Consiquently , banning computers would have a positive effect . Today , many are loosing their ability to write card forgetting about the simple things life has to offer would writing an essay with a pencil and paper be so bad ? This @ MONTH1 be old fashioned , but there are an enormous amount of great effects for using pen and paper . Maybe , the @ ORGANIZATION2 states would become smarter and contain more knowledge . By writing everything out is proven to help remember important facts easier and for a longer amount of time , writing on paper is like writing it in you brain . Therefore , students , children and adults would benefit by having better handwriting . Since most information is typed on the computer people are forgetting how to write neatly , clearly , and resonsibly . @ PERSON1 is an english teacher that has been with the @ ORGANIZATION1 school since before computers , she has seen the horrible effects taking place on her students right befor her eyes . @ PERSON1 told me , "" @ CAPS1 , students are completely absorbed in computers and have no life , energy , or reativeness in them anymore ! Kids have too many advantages with computers and not taking the time . Last , but most definetley not least is my third reason as to computers are effecting humans negetively . Humans are sending huge amounts of money on getting the latest computer technology . Most of people pay chedes are being used for their computers . These fancey computers are very expensive , but also very useless . In my opinion many people are just following a trend . Instead , the money can be spent on schools , and especially the wars ! Do you hear the humming of the computer the clicking of the buttons ? Realize that these sounds are not what you should be spending ! To wrap it up , computers effect people . There are many reasons to support this , but here are three . One is that people are not spending any time in nature ! Another is that people of all ages are becoming brainwashed by this electronic and not spending the time to learn things in quality . Thirdly , people are using all there money on those computers !

I soon got chubby and gained about @ NUM2 lbs ! I quickly realized the computer is a tool used only when necessary . because it shortens activity time .

I mean , people are too busy looking up things on the web that nobody can truly appreciate . the outside world . I remember when i watched the movie @ CAPS2 last week , I thought to myself , "" @ CAPS3 , nature is amazing , why did not I notice before ? "" I already know the answer .

Obviously , nature is ignored by society because of computers . Familes grow more and more detached every time a child or even adult uses a computer . I mean , every time you hit that on switch , you and the computer become attached . You can not focus on the people around you . I remember when my sister @ PERSON5 was in @ NUM5 grade , she never took her eyes off the computer . She would play solitore and instant message her friends all the time and she then completely disconnected with the family .

9792,619,1,"Dear local newspaper , @ CAPS1 a society we have come very for regarding advancements and inventions . One invention has made a large impact in the world and still ceases to amaze . it is the computer . This piece of technology has so many benefits and positive effects on people that without it , everyone would be stupefied . For exomple , this device allows people to keep in touch using a common social network . In addition , specially designed computers can tend to peoples specific needs . Furthermore , they allow you to expand your knowledge . Therefore computers have positive effects . Just think of all the people you have emailed or instant messaged in the past week . Your dad , while he was on his busness trip , your aunt and uncle who e - mailed you pictures of their new born baby , your friends from camp . The list can go on and on . Computers like @ CAPS2 or @ CAPS3 provide social networking like @ CAPS4 , i - chat , video chat and more so you can keep in touch with your family and friends . For example , in my life I use my @ CAPS5 to video chat with my sister , @ PERSON3 , who is a freshman at college in @ LOCATION1 . it is our way of keeping in touch instead of not seeing her for months on end or having to pay for plane tickets every weekend to go down and see her . With the computer keeping in touch with people in different towns , states , or even hemispheres is a piece of cake . However , computers also provide surfaces for those with medical needs . If someone has just been rushed to the hospital for an emergency , computers will be used to monitor that person . @ PERCENT1 of hospitals nationwide say that computers are on essential in their facilities . For example , when my grandfather , @ PERSON2 was being cared for at the @ CAPS6 hospital , computers were used to make sure his heart rate , oxygen levels , and blood pressure were all in check . And , if something was wrong . the computer would alert the doctors . Therefore , computers are also a huge help in the medical department @ CAPS1 we will . Lastly , computers can expand one ' s knowledge . There are thousands upon thousands of websites ; all of which can teach people different things . For example if you are going on a trip to @ LOCATION2 and wish to learn about their culture before you leave , you can just type it into your internet browser on your computer and bam ! you are fully prepared for your vacation now because of your computer . Also , in my life , my teachers assign @ CAPS1 research papers requiring us to find information on a topic . Perhaps going the library is not an option , how are you going to acquire the information ? The answer is simple , go on the internent ! Internent research is the top way amongst all colleges and universities to research . I was recently assigned a @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 project by my social studies teacher , @ PERSON1 where we got to choose my topic of community service and research it . Every student in my class used the computer in some way , shape , or form for their project . Thus , computers can allow you to get information efficiently . In conclusion , computers provide an abundances of uses . Primary ones include the ability to exchange messages with friends and family , help in the medical field , and expansion of knowledge . Henceforth , I believe that computers serve @ CAPS1 a positive advancement in technology and it is effect on people are rather great .",11.0,300,4.9811867999309,15.916666666666664,36,0.5226480836236934,7.0,1.7090592334494774,1.5605358276194943,0.0313588850174216,36.0
9795,243,1,"Dear , @ ORGANIZATION1 , @ CAPS1 would life effect you if you did not have a computer ? I strongly belive that computers have a great effect on people all around the world . It helps you at work for a job and at school . Computers also help students and adults talk to people . Many people want to go to places but they do not know what the place looks like or where it is . With a computer , you can find out all of that information . Read in to the minds of the students and see what we have to say on this topic . With a computer it is much easier at your job or at school . Just think , without computers people would need to write every paper by hand and we all know that can take hours . When you type a paper for school , you go to spell check and then you know everything is correct . If you write a paper by hand , there is a huge chance that some words could be spelt wrong . Work get finished a lot a quicker on the computer so you have more time to do other things like hang out with friends . If you rush on a paper , the people reading it will have a tough time trying to figure out what it says , on the computer , you work is always going to be neat . You mcan e - mail your work to a friend or save it to your computer so if . you need to change something for a paper , it will be a quicker than having to rewrite the whole paper over . Computers do not effect me in a horrible way because it helps ' me get my work done faster . Computers help people communicate with other people . By having a computer people can talk to other people . In many schools students ask their friend a question about homework . Without a computer , people would have no way of asking questions and end up getting it wrong . I like to hang out with my friends and in order to do that you have to make plans . When you are on the computer , you can go on facebook and if they are on , talk to them about what they wanted to do kthat night . It is so much easier to do instead of looking up their number and calling them . Many people in the world have old friends from school that they want to stay in touch with . Now with a computer they will have no issue doing that . You will finally be able to look up a place you want to go . Many people in this world like to travel on the computer you can look up maps and see the shortest way to get to the place , you want to go , you will see if they easy way to get there and that might not he by car . i would not want to go to a place that did not look eye catching . Now I can just go on the website and find out ' everything I wanted to know about that place . If a place is @ NUM1 hours away , I would not want to travel that far so I would need to know if a place is close to where I live computers really tell you a lot about it and what the weather is mostly like . i use the computer for mostly everything I do . Comming through our minds have showed you what we have thought about the effects computers have on us today . We can make work a lot easier , talk to other ; people , and get imformation on places you want to visit somebody . The computer is a very reliable source for me and you have lost a lot if you do not agree with me on this .",11.0,224,4.949277366304365,18.61764705882353,34,0.35331230283911674,5.0,1.4132492113564668,1.1302781873214731,0.012618296529968454,34.0

What I believe is the best thing about computers , is that it is a great source to learn . The internet can connect all over the world , and you can learn about other cultures .

In old times you would have to draw it out by hand using numerous instruments and tools , but now you could make the design using just one tool , the computer . It is a much away way to to you job and if assists the customers because before if the wanted the house to be a different you would have help to draw it all over again . Now you just have to make an ajustment on the computer and in seconds it is done with the new design . These day if not @ PERCENT2 then @ PERCENT1 of house designers use computers . Computers also play in a social role . On the internet you can connect and chat with friends . Also you could share pictures of both of you at a baseball game @ DATE1 to keep memories .

It would mre costly taken over two houses just to find the same information that five minutes using a computer . The internet can millions websites and photo on a wide variety of toys and faster than any other method . As we will as for research , school use computers to type papers . This moves than easier to road the teacher and provides useful tools like spell check . Also , using the internet you can access all of the communicate benefits of using computers .

Computers allow people to interact with other people at once even when they can not be with that person for whatever reason . This communication element is very important just like how they will help for the future . Many jobs involve the usage of a computer mastering how to use the computer before . It is needed has many advantages . If we already know how to use them we do not need to worry about learning in life . Also in the closer future computer will be used in high school and college for helping paper researching and morw it will be faster and easier for us it we have knowledge of how to do these things .

9803,710,1,"Dear local newspaper , Are computers a bad thing ? Certainyly not ! They can be distracting but in a enlighting way . How ? Computers give you extra knowledge , you can connect with people and if you think they take away exercise , they do not , they can actually help exercise !

With sites like facebook , @ CAPS3 , @ CAPS4 , @ CAPS5 , and more we are talking to those people instantly ! We are setting up our weekend plans online and a lot of our social life is there .

9804,1720,1,"Dear @ PERSON1 , @ CAPS1 in your newspaper , I read an article that sparked my interest . The article was about the negative effects computers have on the community . I could not help but disagree with the article , @ PERSON1 because , in my opinion , computers are a step in the right direction for modern technology . I believe computers are a benefit to society because they premote hand - eye coordination , you can learn about almost anything , and you can talk online to other people . How do computers help with hand - eye coordination , you ask ? When you are typing on the computer your eyes are on the screen while your hands are typing and strengthening at an incredible rate ! A study made by students at @ ORGANIZATION1 shows that the chances of developing arthritis by the time you are @ NUM1 dropped almost @ PERCENT1 in people that use computers often . Also , the hand - eye coordination you get from typing , goes a long way in sports such as tennis and baseball . So if someone needs to build up their hand eye coordination I suggest that they take a computer class , like the ones that are offered in many schools all over the country . Secondly , using the internet on computers makes finding information on a variety of subjects much easier . Say you wanted to go on vacation with your family . Instead of calling a number , why not go online and plan your entire trip from your computer . There are so many websites that make it fast and easy . In addition , sites can teaching people how to clothings are always nearby . If you wanted to learn how to knit , just type in "" how to knit "" in your favorite search engine and there are over @ NUM2 sites to help you , making it easy to learn to make a great or fix a bike . In addition to learning about new things the internet allows you to friends . After camp , I would always say "" oh we will keep in touch , "" but I never would be able to keep any promise . Once I found an instant messager or webcam application on the internet , it was very easy to talk to my friends . Every once in a while I talk to my friend who now lives in @ LOCATION1 ! Also , my dad is always stressed about meetings with other countries , but now that he can use webcams to talk to his other international bosses , he is so excited about his meetings . He always says that the computers nowadays are very easy to use for talking to people .

Computers were mode to simply difficult situations , such as typing , finding , and keeping a record of financial statuses . Despite the main uses , many @ CAPS3 citizens have been using the computer for that are neccessary which result in a loss of to living a healthy , social , life . these are exercisem and spending line with fellow people indicating family and friends . as a result , please read on so that you , the @ CAPS4 our can understand why computers have became out of hand and relay my message to the readers of your . One much life is exercise , and due to the of modern computers , exercise is the key to a healthy life . Personally , I know at least poor young children in my very school that are a victim of the cruel disease , known as obesity . The reason for the dese children is quite simple - they over use , and forget the natural bounderies to using something . Practically every day , each of the foor heart - children begin to their computers from the second will home , to the moment they fall asleep . this outrageous number of hours the vital the to exercise , therefore allows their bodies to adopt to the habits of the children sleep , eat , computer . This upselling manor of the foor kids enables others to pick on them for being fat , yet they can not fight back , they have what so ever , thus the over use of computers can result in a over weight child , with no exercise , and no power / muscle to depend themselves from . Another reason whay computers are thinking such a @ LOCATION1 ' s youth , is because of less than medicine usage of . Everyday I chose to walk from school , for the breathly sounds of type of wheather day should I hope you I @ CAPS5 , spending time with your friend and family yet ones again people who abuse see the importance of this . Around two years ago , I was on the computer non - stop , @ CAPS6 , playing video games , and all sorts of computer - released activities . every day , constantly , for about a year , I came home , to on the computer , and began my , as I @ LOCATION2 .

9806,111,1,"@ CAPS1 judgment comes from expirience , and expirience comes from bad judgement , qouted from my uncle ' s dad . Computers have not been around all that long for the public , so the public has little experience . Therefore , the public also lacks @ CAPS1 judgement in using computers and the detrimental effects are starting to show . Computers have caused damage to people ! To begin with , computers can be a @ CAPS2 issue for people . In studies in @ LOCATION1 , @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 @ CAPS3 who spend their time ( @ NUM3 or more hours ) are wearing glasses . Because of bad @ CAPS2 effects the screen has on your eyes . Furthermore , computer games are made to be addicting , which causes @ CAPS3 to sit in front of the computer instead of excercising . This @ MONTH1 be one of the biggest causes of obesity in @ LOCATION2 ! My little brother used to be addicted to a flying game , and he sat in front of it for hours every day and started to get fat . As soon as he stopped playing it and going outside more he immediatly started to lose fat . Therefore , people need to move around more instead of sitting in front of the computer . To continue , my second argument is about detrimental effects computers have on the enviroment . First , computers need electricity to run . That electricity comes from power plants . Over @ PERCENT1 of @ LOCATION2 ' s powerplants are coal , petroleum , or natural gas based . When people turn on the computer because they are bored , it wastes electricity that does not need to be used . Furthermore , scientists suspect humans are now a major cause of global warming . It is common sense that those powerplants burn their respective fuels to create electricity . In other words there is a definite connection between computers and global warming . Also , the powerplants release pollutants into the air that can eventually cause acid rain . To end with , my last argument is about people ' s skills . In a school survey , @ CAPS3 who used their computers for more than @ NUM4 hours per day did not know how to cook or how to even light a match ! There is a definite connection between the two as most people just put something in the microwave to eat to be able to go back to the computers as fast as possible . The matches are lit by parents to light fires or candles , But what happens when a natural disaster strikes like in @ LOCATION3 or @ LOCATION4 ? How will @ CAPS3 be able to fend for themselves ? The only way to cook would be with fire . There would not be microwaves to cook canned food with . Furthermore , how would @ CAPS3 be able to even start a fire without @ CAPS4 how to light a match ? Evidently excessive computer use could have very detrimental effects in a natural disaster , even to adults , so we need to stop it ! Do you want @ LOCATION2 to be thought of as @ CAPS5 and @ CAPS6 ? Should the enviroment , our only home , suffer because of a few bored people ? How will we handle a major natural disaster ? In conclusion , people are spending too much time on their computers , and they need to stop ! People are becoming @ CAPS6 , @ CAPS7 the environment , and losing important life skills . We need to all come together and cooperate to keep people healthy , to retain our life skills , but most importantly ssave our one and only beautiful @ LOCATION5 .",11.0,275,5.0481465073675595,15.444444444444445,36,0.4937163375224417,6.0,1.6427289048473968,1.38210225325431,0.04488330341113106,36.0

All of the programs available via the computer can help you with real life obstacles and make you think createvly . Next , computers allow you to learn about faraway places and people . This is espicially interesting because you can learn about a countries culture without actually going there . This oppurtunity allows you to imerse yourself in different cultures and religions and would make it easier to relate to people to in faraway lands . @ CAPS4 once said "" @ CAPS3 are afraid of only what is different than us , therefore , @ CAPS3 have nothing to fear if nothing is different .

There ' s probably a @ PERCENT1 chance she will not ever talk to ou again . and I do not blame her . People who spend to much time on the computer , would barely understand what is going on . @ CAPS2 someone tells you something , it goes in one ear and out the other . @ CAPS1 people do this , its really dissappointing because you do not hang out as much as with your friends and family . As you can see , people are spending too much time on the computer than excersing , enjoying nature , and spending time with family and friends . @ CAPS2 you ask me , I do not play on the computer as much which is a good thing .",11.0,212,4.8450726752889,18.580645161290324,31,0.36741767764298094,5.0,1.4211438474870015,1.1702295713931186,0.01733102253032929,31.0
9813,1269,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 of the @ ORGANIZATION1 , @ CAPS2 has come to my attention that several people are concerned with the technology boom and computer overuse . I can assure you that technocal upgrades only harm our people . Email and @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 have only given us a decrease in our already terrible communication skills . Furthermore , we spend less and less time exercising outside because we are trapped in a technology revolution filled with inaccurate information . Why are we hurting ourselves instead of helping ? @ CAPS2 is very clear that our teens are growing up with no communication skills . I remember reading a persuasive essay and realizing that they used @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 based language . @ CAPS2 is ridiculous that we are forgetting how to use the proper grammar of the @ CAPS7 language . Furthermore , I have also observed that when my friends talk they use slang terms like "" @ CAPS8 "" and "" @ CAPS9 "" . I understant that computers after a faster and much easier way to communicate but we definetley can not forget the work of @ CAPS10 . With the , people who should hope that they do not become a biggest loser contestant say @ CAPS2 , but , if they continue to mind on their then they will join the millions of obese . Americans I think that when people at their computer they tend to bring junk food with them and for ! contrast to this from spending these hours with @ ORGANIZATION2 instead of Exercising and let you creative wild would citizen rather pay for a computer or the vast , free , and gorgeous ? Furthermore , people are wasting their important attention . A fact that over three of the information in is not reliable therefore . Also , statistics show that nearly @ PERCENT1 of students use to . These statistics also display that when students use these sites they clearly will score lower than a student who did the seemingly "" daunting "" task of looking for the reasearch in a textbook . What is so daunting about @ CAPS2 ? Obviously , nothing is overwhelming . @ CAPS2 is only pleasure when the student will get a phenomenal grade and their surronding classmates will not . Furthermore , I ask you why are people flooding their brains with unrealiable information ? In conclusion , the effects computers have on people are very negative . Due to this , many people have no communication skills . They are also more likely to become less obese and if that is not enough they are hurting themselves because they are obsessed with inaccurate information .

There is one thing about the computer that is amazing . That is socilizing with friends , family or even strangers . You know when your parents say never talk to strangers we will , you can do this saftely and harmless over the computer , and you also learn alot about life or other peoples life outside your small little town . There is another @ CAPS1 perk with computers and that is keeping in touch with family or friends that live far away . My sister went to @ LOCATION1 for six months , but the thing was it felt like two weeks because I was able to communicate and se pictures of here @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 . The last but probably the most important part is getting ahold of . People you actually really need talk to , such as friends , teachers or even people you never talk to in school . With these three advanced ways to soliaze it will always feel like your never alone which an awsome thing . There is many other things the computer is used for other than social life , and that is actuall important use , stuff you need to know or want to find out . Here is one example , everone has forgot there work at school or your office at least once in your life . we will with being able to just grab all the papers off line is easy . Just go to your teachers home page and just print your homework . it is that easy just one click and that saved you a twenty minuet ride to school . How about when your up at night wondering what the weather is going to be lik , many sunny , cold or even a glorious snow day . we will instead of waiting to find out you can just go on weather . com and see everything maps , forecast or what is going to happen hour by hour . Just like weather people always want to know breaking news . Why watch an two hour show when you can just get to the point off what is happening in this world we live in . I mean the parents have to open there eyes and seethis a buetiful thing . We should be proud of the fact that humans have created somthing so complex and intresting . There is one more topic that I know you are going to absoltly love . I mean right now your grading this in your office , well you can be grading this at home on your comfortble couch , with a fire crackling and all the peace and quiet in the worl . People work from home all the time . you can run a business from your very own living room . My father owns company and works from home most days . it is absoutly @ CAPS1 be is able to take me out , spend time with the family and most importantly doing the things he loves and guess what , you can do this too . Like I keep saying it is only a click away here is another topic , online banking . Do you really want to drive to the bank and sit down with that borring acountant and spend hours there , well , now you do not have to waste your time , you can type in a couple keys and boom , your on your way to see your information . That was faster then two hours I am guessing . Yes , I believe that computers are a @ CAPS1 use of time and will also help alot in the future .

Computers fasinate many and can become very adicting if not used only in moderation . Computers are also attention hogs and take away interaction with family . Imagine seven years of your life sitting in front of a computer . You never get up unless you absolutely need to . You even decide to cut the sports from your life . Now imagine what that does to your body . Even if you ate right , the never excersising part woudl kill you . I remember I was at my cousin @ PERSON2 ' s house when she sugested to play the game @ CAPS2 fit . If you have never played this before , when you sign in , it does some tests and determines the age of your body . My body was @ NUM1 years old . I was a @ NUM2 years old in a @ NUM1 year old body . All those years gone in front of the computer . I do not want that experience to happen to anouther . do not make the same mistake as me readers of the @ LOCATION1 current . I have a friend name @ PERSON1 , and she is a computer addict . She would spend days on end on the computer . Sometimes she would miss school for the computer or come to school just to play on the computer . She would sometimes get violent when someone tried to pull her away . I hated seeing my friend like this , but mostly I hated how I watched it happen . It started off innocent enough . She enjoyed a certain website on the internet . It would sometimes get scary when she talked to me about it and clearly had played it all night . If you are looking at this story and thinking that would never happen to me , your wrong . I was thinking the same way when I took a look at that website that got her started . Thankfully , I stoped my addiction before it got to serious , but many others like @ PERSON1 could and will be absorbed by the computers . Many readers reading this right now , should understand how dangerous and read this is , "" @ CAPS3 ! @ CAPS3 ! I am talking to you ! "" That is the sound of your family members trying to talk to you when your on the computer . It does not work , computers are so attention grabbing , you can not even stand to talk to your own family . My mom does this many times a day to grab my attention and ends up calling my cell phone or I . ming me . that is really just sad . By doing this you also become detatched which is never a good thing . The more and more you ignore your family for the computer the less of a bond you will have , the less of a life you will have . Computers truly are amazing , but the loss of excersise is very unhealthy and rapidly happening . Computers can also be dangerous , many people will get addicted . The more you chat on chat room to strangers , the less you will talk to your family . Computers are the devils tools . They will most certainly destroy you , readers .

In fact , @ ORGANIZATION2 , in @ LOCATION1 , @ CAPS1 , just began using these games as part of their training this @ DATE1 . Instructors report that @ ORGANIZATION2 skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past . Additionally , computer games can improve reflexes . Two years ago , a man named @ PERSON3 , @ NUM1 years old , fell onto the train tracks just as a train was coming by .

Another reason for why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to talk online . They even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away , strengthening your relationships . I recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to @ LOCATION3 . Letters were too expensive and took too long , but email and skype provide us with a great alternative .

Computer act like teachers teaching us without us even knowing it . Hand - eye coordination is a perfect example . Plus , we use computers to learn about places we might want to travel to , or have a conversation with frinds or family living ways away tromus . Computers is an extrodarny piece or technology . First , I like to say everything that you do physically uses hand - eye coordination . Making dinner , riding a bike , driving a car etc . And unfortiunitly not @ CAPS6 people are the best at hand - eye coordination . One of @ CAPS7 friends , @ PERSON1 , had horriable hand eye coordination .

Do you really want to travel up to the icey cold , and piercing winds of the @ LOCATION1 just to learn about it ? For some I ' d say like that but what if you can not travel up the @ LOCATION1 due to money or flying conditions .

They can experience the @ ORGANIZATION1 lights without needing to travel into the bitter cold . Lastly , that better thing to do on the computer than with family you have never met before or do not get to see them . The editor for the @ LOCATION3 Local states "" @ CAPS7 parents live over @ NUM8 miles away . I rarly get to tell to them now because I can not afford to travel that distance ofter .

It was easy to find out how life was in @ LOCATION2 , thanks to the actual @ CAPS1 girl explaining it . Going to the library would not have filled one with this priceless information and human interection . Computers are a nessessity of life if soceity wishes to grow and expand . They should be supported because they teach hand eye coordination , give people the ability to learn about faraway places , and allow people to talk to others online . Firstly , computers help teach hand eye coordination . Hand - eye coordination is a useful ability that is usod to excel in sports . In a recent survey , @ PERCENT1 of kids felt their hand eye coordination improves after computer use . Even a simple thing like tying can build up this skill . Famous neurologist @ CAPS2 @ PERSON1 stated in an article last week that , "" @ CAPS3 and computer strength the @ CAPS2 . When on the computer , you automatically process what the eyes see into a command for your hands . "" @ CAPS4 hand eye coordination can improve people in sports such as baseball and basketball . If someone wan ' t to become better in these sports , all they had need to do was turn on the computer . Once people become better at sports , they are more likely to play them and become more healthy . In reality , computers can help with exercising instead of decreasing it . Additionaly , computers allow people to access information about faraway places and people . If someone wanted to reasearch @ LOCATION1 , all they had need to do was type in a search would be presented to them in it would link forever to search through countless things . Also , having the ability to learn about cultures can make peole peole and their cultures , they understand others something . Increase tolerance people are . Computers are a resourceful tool that they can help people in every different aspect of life . Lastly , computer and in technology can allow people to chat . Computer chat and video chat can help the all different nations . Bring on good terms places other than can help us understand story comes out about something that happend in @ LOCATION3 , people can just go on their computer and ask an actual @ LOCATION3 citizen their take on the matter . Also , video chat and online conversation can cut down on expensive phone bills . No one wants to pay more than they have to in this economy . Another good point is that you can acess family members you scaresly visit . It can help you connect within your own family more . Oviously , computers are a useful aid in todays era . their advancements push the world foreward to a better place . Computers can help people because they help teach handeye coordination , give people the bility to learn about faraway places and people , and allow people to talk online with others . Think of a world with no computers or technologicall advancements . The world would be sectored and unified , contact between people scare , and information even .

9860,1000,1,"The effect computers have on humans is by far a positive one , and the outstanding intelligence computers provide must be embraced , not feared and avoided . Whether we like it or not , computers will be necessary to solve issues of the future . Besides , for personal usage , computers are highly beneficial . The main reason people fear computers is because of the dangers is radiates , which really is not reasonable , when analyzed closely . To not use such a complex and developed system such as the computer is completely irrational , the computer is the future plain and simple . It is inevitable that the computer and technology related to that , paint the picture of the future of our world . Whether people like the concept or not , computers will be necessity to solve the problems and calamities that will wreak havoc on the world in time . Computers can predict natural disasters , and with that , people in the area of the catastrophe is destination can be evacuated . Lives can be saved . Computers can calculate , pollutional margins , and provide solutions to the large amount of pollution humans release in the air and @ CAPS1 . @ ORGANIZATION1 Nature can be spared . So much more can be attained by putting the computer to full use . People must adapt to @ LOCATION1 technology , or we will fall behind and watch our @ CAPS1 slip away . This proves the effect computers have on people is not only positive , but necessary to advance in an ever - growing world . Stepping down to a less global level of effects and to a more personal level proves to also be beneficial to humans . Computers in most cases , do better work and create less error than humans themselves . Instead of requiring humans to work in dangerous locations such as deep water , computers can be sent down to visualize the before unattainable areas . Also , faster communication is extremely helpful in certain circumtances , such as an occurance in a workplace causing the area to be off - limits . As member of the workplace can simply e - mail his employer , informing them of the accuracy and preventing them from putting themselves in danger , or simply preventing men the trouble of a commute to work . Even from @ LOCATION1 to @ LOCATION2 , with simply the press of "" @ CAPS2 "" , people across the world can be of the accident . Foreign communication , specifically by means of instant messaging can strengthen our tie with other nations , in the fields of both business and government . Lastly , finding information , is so easy with a @ CAPS3 . Where would be without computers to find information rapidly ? We would be still going to the library and checking out books , reading through page after page to find the information that would have taken less even a minute on a computer . Even a person agreed computer would have to admit that to be highly beneficial . As you can see , on even a less global level of use , the computer still proves to have a positive effect on it is users . The one thing , parents especially , that fuels the negative opinion on computers is safety and reliability . When these two topics are analyzed , it is so simple to eliminate unreliability and danger of the computer . Installing a program of which there are infinite to choose from , that allows "" good "" websites to be viewed , and "" bad "" on potentially dangerous @ CAPS4 to be binded . This eliminates all that is heard about on - line interactions and activity gone bad . Even without software to block dangerous websites , computers are generally safe . Only @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 websites , includes content considered "" detrimental "" to humans . Also , of those @ NUM2 , @ NUM4 provide reliable , correct information . Those two statistics annihilate the question of safety and reliability that some users come to ponder . That goes to show that the computer ' s negative aspects can be eliminate , leaving only the positives to remain . In conclusion , computers have a far more positive influence on users than negatives . Computers are the future , and have even proven to save lives . Why would not somebody want to save the life of another ? Also , the benefits of @ CAPS3 , or personal computers , are too large and helpful to pass up . Lastly , when viewed carefully , computers are very reliable , and can be made extremely safe , which eliminates the main fear computers .

9901,859,1,"The innovation of computers was a great leap into discovery . Unfortunately , the negative aspects of this magnificent invention detract from the novelty . With the computer came a plague of not exercising and a disinterest in , perhaps even an inabilty to enjoy nature . On top of this destruction of the mind , this monster is the cruel cause of many declining relationships for who has time for friends and family while in the middle of an internet game ? As unique and intriguing as the computer might be , it is slowly destroying the mind . Increasing interest in a monitor tends to result in decreasing care for exercise as we will as a decline in the amount of exercise gotten each day . While playing on the computer , the mind @ MONTH1 be racing but the body sits unmoving , @ CAPS1 activity is being done . Indeed , for some the addiction is awful enough that the person only moves to get food , use a restroom , go to bed or when a parent demands it . All of the day ' s food settles into the stomach and little to none of it is burned off . Meanwhile , in some of the more severe cases the person is so entranced that bedtimes are pushed later . Sleep is essential to the body and mind and going without can be damaging . Nowadays the computer detracts from the sleep and exercise that the body requires . Even nature suffered from the advent of computers . Fewer people went out to admire it is beauty . Nature is a wonderful teacher about the circle of life and the natural way of the world . Oftentimes parallels can be drawn between the wild and the tamed . Attached as people are to computers , they cannot experience the world to the fullest . Some argue that flora and fauna can be found online , but seeing a picture is different , almost cheating , compared to being beside the plant , able to study it from all angles rather than in an unmoving form . The experience is not the same . Also , computers are indoors , so the true world is chielded from view . Even nowadays with laptops if one was to be brought outside , the user would be focusing on the screen , not what is around them . Computers have severely cut down on the admiration of nature . Even family and friends suffer when computers are around . Many people barely pay attention to conversation while focusing on the screen . They tend to onlypretend to listen half the time . Even when chatting with friends online , the conversation is disjointed because attention is probably focused on another part of the internet . Frequently , during conversations without a computer nearby , the mind is focused on something from earlier that day . Relationships are suffering , and computers are at fault . Computers are sucking in society , more of it each day . Much of what is done on computers , like the study of faraway places , can easily be found in books . Computers have resulted in a lack of exercise , less time with nature , strained relationships , and a generally unhealthy lifestyle . Through all of this , they have returned little to society .

9903,346,1,"Dear @ LOCATION1 , @ CAPS1 a teanger growing up in this technologic era @ MONEY1 society , I think computers are more harmful than helpful . I presume that books are better resources , people can find fun in other ways and that computers can be dangerous and cause health problems . @ CAPS1 a we will - read newspaper , your stand on this subject will influence the minds @ MONEY1 many . I know computers can help find information , but personally , I believe that books are better resources . Anyone can write and post an article on the internet , even if what they are saying is not true at all . People can lie and say they are a doctor in their @ NUM1 ' s when they are really a @ NUM2 year old working at @ ORGANIZATION1 . On the computer , you can never be sure who to believe , but with books you know what you are reading is accurate . The information on the computer , ( that is true ) you can find a book . Sure , the computer @ MONTH1 be the quicker or "" easy way @ CAPS6 "" in some cases , but maybe what people need is a challenge . It seems that because @ MONEY1 the growing technology , every generation gets lazier and lazier , and less and less into books and it is time for that to stop . Also , people can find fun in many other ways not involving a computer . Many people use social networking sites to connect with their friends , such @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 , @ CAPS3 and @ CAPS4 , but on those , you can not tell if that person is really who they say they are or not . If you want to talk to your friends , why not call them or more modernly , text them ? That way you can be sure @ MONEY1 who you are talking to . Too many teens nowadays hide @ CAPS6 in their rooms and play games on their computers and spend less and less time with their families . What happend to playing cards and board games with your family ? it is much more enjoyable , in my opinion if you play the game for real and not virtually . You can also go outside and get some fresh air , instead @ MONEY1 that muggy smell in your room because you are so busy on the computer , you forgot to @ CAPS5 the laundry . Plus , if kids have to start handwriting their papers that would improve their handwriting , because they would not get the simplicity @ MONEY1 typing . Besides , some kids do not have access to computers , anyways and you have to handwrite your @ ORGANIZATION2 ' s , so why not ? Lastly computers can be dangerous and / or harmful to health . The use @ MONEY1 social networks allows kids to put all their information @ CAPS6 there , for anyone to see . This can lead to bad things , like being stalked or kidnapped . The internet also carries many innapropriate images and websites , that youngsters , or anybody , really , should be looking at also staring at a computer screen for hours on end is very bad for your eyes and can cause very serious vision problems in the long run .

Getting rif @ MONEY1 computers will help to impact peoples ' we will - being - in a positive manner . While many people enjoy the use @ MONEY1 computers , there is really not that great @ MONEY1 a need for them . Books are better resources , you can find fun in many other ways , and they can be dangerous / harmful to health . Why spend hundreds or @ MONEY1 on a tool that is not even necessary ? do not let the media fool you or pull you in with their tricks , scams , or gimmicks to get you buy one , and next time you go to turn on your computers , thinks "" @ CAPS5 I really need this or is there a better way to achieve what I need to get done or what I want to @ CAPS5 ?

These books inclued encyclopedias that give statistics and , pores , and events that are in the far of place . For example if you are planning a trip you can learn where to eat and where to get entertained . you can learn about far of places and people in them with computers .
