8149,923,1,"Dear @ PERSON1 , Experts are concerned about the use of computers . They say that they spend hours on the computer and less time exercising enjoying nature , and interacting with family and friends . I agree . While people use the computers , they do not interact and meet new friends in person . They stay inside and do not get excersise , and kids might talk with strangers . When we use computers we chat with friends online and do not really interact with others . We meet new friends and chat online and never meet them and socialize , so that is one disadvantage of a computer . Another problem is lack of exercise . While we are on the computer we spend a lot of time and sometimes causes us to even forget to exercise . Then we slowly begin to get unhealthy . Another major problem of computers is talking or chatting with strangers . Some might meet some random people online and give them personal info .

They can been used to look up information , talk to family and friends music etc . do not you think people are wasting more time on the computer instead of getting exercise . it is clear that computers can do just about anything want than to do . But why spend your time on the computer when you can spend time with your family . Playing sports , or getting some fresh air . I think computers have a positive effect on people and negative effect one of the positive effects is being able to talk to your friends . i know sometimes we are not able to see them as much in school . In my opinion I think it is a great way so you can catch up on funny times that you can and friends shared . Now here comes the negative effect . Mang kids get bulled and picked by other kids over the internet . This can cause other kids to have a low self esteem , and cause dangerous events in the future . When it comes to computer they have saved many people life . Some of these ways are finding cures to harmful deases . Computers have information when serious weather storms are coming and prepare us for the weather . would not you agree that computers have played a huge role in our lifes .

Computers can also be used for amusement . Games , music , and videos are always on the internet . Contacting other people is also a great reason why computers are not bad . People can always have an e - mail for business and friends . Myspace , @ CAPS3 , and @ CAPS4 are all websites that people can contact others . Having a computer is not always bad .

I would like for you to appreciate my concern on how @ CAPS1 society should have computers . First , we should have computers because it teaches us things that we might not have been taught before . I say this because if you wanna know about the @ LOCATION1 more and the school or job does not teach you as much as you wanna know , then all you have to do is look up on the internet and theres a chance you gonna find it . @ NUM1 people would rather have computers to look up things instead of not knowing that much about something at all . Next , we should have computers for @ CAPS1 society because we could contact people online that we heven ' t spoke to . My opinion is that if you have not to a friend or family member in a while you can talk to them online . Also , if they do not have a phone or if they do but it is long distance and you can not talk to long distance on your phone , you can tlak to them on or email each other , etc . Sample say if your phone is not working and the only thing that is working is your computer you to it in contact with somebody . All you gotta do is talk to them online .

8188,374,1,"Dear local Newspaper , I believe that people who uses alot of technology such as computer are not good , technology can affect adults and even more is children . Children who go on chatting websites such as facebook are starting to see a difference which is in there grades . I found out children who gois on face book are starting to not turn in home work and there grades are going completly down , I heard a student say once he had got on face book he stoped doing his homework and reading his grade dropeed from a @ CAPS1 t a @ CAPS2 average because he was much focused on the computer than school and his reading . I belive computers can be really addicted to people the first time you get on a website it go ' s from once a day to twice a day and further on it is as if the computer is sometime connected to you and we can let go . People who allow themself to chat online can also be a dangerous thing , young females and males think it is exciting to chat with some one in a different state or city but it is not exciting it is very dangerous . Chating online is very dangerous because the person that you are talking to could have murdered people or could have kidnapped kids or could be wanied but we would not know because on chat lines you do not have to put your fear name , you could put a false picture , and unknown age that is why in cases something go missing because they didd ' ent think before they started chating . Another reason why using or being on a computer can be bad because it can lead to a strong distraction from you family instead of sitting down and asking your family now was thier day you will be in a rush to go on the computer . The computer can also lower you test and quiz grades you can be on the computer for a maximum of hours that you need to be studying for a huge exam the next day and when you fail theres no one to blame but yourself because of your addiction to the usage of an computer .

I am writing to you today to tell you my opinion on the effects computers have on people with their time usage , what they are doing , and computer dead . If you will please continue on I would like to share with you my thoughts . Computers today are consuming our world . People are spending way to much time on the computer . I believe they should set a timer on how long they are on the computer . Lets say they set a @ NUM1 hour limit then once it is up they have to get off . I think this would help because if were spending to much time inside were not gonna be able to get enough exercise , which is not good for our health . Please continue on to learn about how we should use the computer . Parents have to set a good example for kids . If parents use the computer @ NUM2 then their child will think it is ok to do so . If the child then starts spending all their time on the computer then they will not be spending anytime with their friends . Kids today need to spend more time outside then playing games on the computer . Also the parents and child need to spend time together , if they are both on the computer they can not spend time together . Please read on about how we will go computer dead . Computer dead is a term I call when all we want to do is use the computer . We need to be healthy about our computer usage . If we are not then we could start to get withdrawls from the computer and then will spend more time on the computer . If you go computer dead then it will slowly start to take over our lives . I think if this does happen it will be hard to get over an stop using the computer . Please read on to finish reading my letter . Thank for reading about how we need to mange our time issues , how we use the computer and computer dead . I hope you will consider my thoughts .

But people abuse it like ther @ CAPS2 games and their do not even go outside they do not talk to there friends or even see ther friends it is mostly not haven a life . And people do not feel like going to school because their over and there tired and ther just want to use the computer all day with not stopping . And so i think that people are just to addicted to compulers they do not use it for the fright reasons . Had then people get sick they could get hoadaks or they feel like puking . And they do not get to see that of things like go to the @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 football , soccer , @ CAPS3 , valleyball or even take there own dog for a walk at the @ CAPS1 . @ CAPS4 of people buy computers for games and @ CAPS4 or muture people buy computer for there work and find were places are so the computer helps @ CAPS4 but it addicted @ CAPS4 of people .

The last reason is because computers can give ability to learn more about things they did not know before . In my opinion I agree with computers benefiting society .

Talking to family and friends without spending money . If you control the amount of time you use on a computer then you will be fine . Please keep reading to hear my great ideas . To start off , computers and other technology make life easier . Think about it we have access to our bank accounts , stores , reasearch , school , etc . See instead of having to go at shoppingfor food you could just order it online with no trouble . We can now shop @ CAPS4 cloths and other household items . it iso easy just to look at a list and pick what you want instead of waiting in a long line . @ CAPS4 example , I went to @ CAPS1 to pick up a few items @ CAPS4 a party . There a long line , so I just got online picked what i wanted and had it shipped to me unless then @ NUM2 hours ! it is cool to not have to even got up to get what you want . I know you sometimes have your since you do not wanna get up ? But you have to go shopping . does not computers make life so easy . Secondly , talk to family and friends without having to spend money . This is awesome because you can text , video chat , email @ CAPS4 free . Computers have so many websites to talk to your family and friends like , @ CAPS2 , @ CAPS3 , myspace , yahoo , and even ohvoo . Mostly , all those you can video chat and voice chat @ CAPS4 free . All of those sites you can text @ CAPS4 free and touch those with your @ CAPS4 example , one day I did not want spend my to talk to my friend . So I just video chatted with them . And it was @ NUM3 times better and free and better . Even @ CAPS4 people long distanceis way to much money in call them . So why not just video chat I know you would not wanna spend hundreds of dollars @ CAPS4 a phone call bill ! Please keep reading . Thirdly , if you count he amount of time you use on he computer of other technology devices then you will be fine . If you limit and set a time on the use of your computer everything will be wonderful . You can tell your body to get off the pc and get a work out or talk to friends . There ' s no way you could be addicted to something if you have a limited @ CAPS4 it . If your the type of person that is a at something . Then @ MONTH1 be you should not get a computer . Like my mom gives me a limited @ CAPS4 the computer @ NUM4 my laptop has to be off on a school night . An @ NUM3 : 00pm my laptop has to be off on the weekends .

Children aroung the world talk to people they hace never seen . People are being abroad because they believe the person they are taking to is the real deal , @ CAPS1 is a great way to communicate just not in the wrong ways . Plagourism is happening all over the world , People just take whatever they want , when they did not create @ CAPS1 . We take if you are caught doing @ CAPS1 , you can go to prison . Although there is a way we van help the plagorism . the internet has all the information in the world , and people abuse @ CAPS1 .

8336,191,1,"Dear The @ CAPS1 , I understand that you have some concerns about computers . I do not think you should be concerned though . You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive . They teach us hand - eye coordination , help teach you about faraway places and people , and finally you can talk online with familly and friends . First , computers teach you hand - eye coordination . There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight . This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen . Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people . This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can not , you just go to your computer and look it up . Then you feal like you are really there . It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you will not get to meat in person . Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends . There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family . The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy . In conclusion I think computers are a great , fun , and helpful invention .

You could get in trouble , and it could effect your education . One reason I think that being on the computer too long is bad for people is because you could get obsessed with it . For example , if you were playing outside on a nice day and you called a friend and asked them to come over and they said no I can not @ CAPS3 on the computer . You said why todays a nice day . Then your friend said @ CAPS3 playing games . that is an example of being obsessed with a computer . Another reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because you could get in trouble . Getting in trouble online is bad because you could get sued or the owner of the website could delete it from your computer . Also if your parents found out you would be in even more trouble because then you would get grounded . That means you would not be able to use the computer for a long time . My last reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because it could effect your education . If someone was on the computer too long instead of doing their homework that could effect their grades a lot . If you are in @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 and this happens you would not be alowd to graduate and go to college . That is not a good thing if you are trying to get into a good college .

First thing is that computers are having a @ CAPS1 effect on people and there life computers are making people just fit inside on their computers all day and do nothing . They just sit there playing games also about @ PERCENT1 of the people who are spending to much time on the computer are probally pating we will their on the computer which that is why some people @ MONTH1 be fat . Most of the people who spend all of they time on the computer is people in there @ NUM1 ' s and @ NUM2 ' s some are in there @ NUM3 ' s or @ NUM4 ' s . Just sitting there on the computer will get you . Where in life . It will not give you a job or school education . By just sitting at the computer for a while you will not be able to do things out side . If so many people were not on the computer all the time then they could be outside . Being outside they can play sports , ride bikes , swim , run and more . They could also get a job and make some money or go to college , kids who are on the computer to much could get out and go to the mall , hang with friends you could get some exercise , or just enjoy nature . There is no use for going on the computer and being there for more then @ NUM5 or @ NUM6 hours , the most you should be on the computer would be an hour to an hour and a half . Kids and teenagers should only go on the computer for homework and the rest of the time doing something eles . we will all of the kids grade through @ NUM7 grade should go out a play with their toys and people @ NUM8 grade and up should hang out with and do thing like go to the mall , see a movie , or just have a sleepover . Also everyone in these grades should interact with there families more by seeing them more then @ NUM7 / @ NUM8 times a month and they could have parties or just get together and hang out . So people should do some of the other things I said instead of just going on the computer all of the time . The last thing is the things that people are doing on the computers which is like I sometimes go on facebook . Other people go on facebook , google , games looking up information , and more . They also have emails where they chat with other people . Another thing people go on is youtube and listen to music and watch veidos . So I do not think that the effect of the computers on people is a good thing . I think that people shoud be out doing things then just sitting at home on the computer .

Computers are becoming more and more popular . Some people think that people use computers too much . I am here to say that , that is a terrible accusation . First , computers help you with school work . Let ' s say you have an essay and it needs to be @ NUM1 words or more you can just use word can not , then you have the exact amount of words . Also you might need to look up some information about a certain topic . You can just simply type in the word and search and then you have millions of choices to choose from . If you had a homework assignment that you did not understand you could look up how to do it on the internet . But this i just the begining . Another reason computers are so great is that you can meet and interact with people all over the world and learn their culture . You can enter a free chatroom and meet someone from @ LOCATION1 . You would also be learning about their culture . This could also be a way to learn another language . If the person spoke fluently in @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2 than he or she could teach you . You might be able to see how an @ CAPS2 household runs . You could then make comparisons between the way you both live your life . Finally , you can understand the world around you . There are many websites where you can get a live sattelite feed on places on every corner of the globe . You could also do reasearch on the planet itself . You can learn about the care of the earth and what goes on inside it . You might also learn about nature . You could understand more about plants and animals . You can also got a look into space . You can learn about planets , if there is life on planets or water or anything else these would be things you can reasearch . So to sum it all up , you can get school work done . You can interact with people all over the world . You can also learn about the world around you and that covers less than a fraction of everything you can do on the computers , but do not stay on all day . Make sure you go outside and have a great time too !",8.0,192,4.742312723337902,13.6,30,0.469437652811736,5.0,1.5256723716381415,1.53012496531497,0.014669926650366746,30.0

For learning , you could learn how to type , write stories , using @ ORGANIZATION1 word , and even learning what is to use on the internet , for hand - eye cordination , you can learn all the keys an the keyboard and what they do to get better skills . My thirdly reason is , how to search on google or the @ LOCATION1 . Google is the most common thing that everyone uses . To look up pictures for projects , labs basiclly for anything .

Others are concerned that people spent too much time on computers and not enough time exercising and spending time with friends and family . I believe that computers can be a bad thing . I think this because some people spend to much time on them , it is one of the leading causes of obesity , and it interfers with people social lifes . According to recent studys , about @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 people spend most of their time on their computers . Many ot these people spend their time on online games and socializing websites such as facebook and myspace . Others spend it shopping or learning . Some of the online games include world of warcraft , rune scope , and many @ CAPS1 ' s @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 games . Many people who spend most of their time on the computer are or @ MONTH1 became obese . According to @ PERSON1 , spending alot of time on computer is one of the main reasons for obesity . Many experts agree that computers are the learning cause of obesity . between @ DATE1 and @ DATE2 more people have been using their computers more often . The obesity rate has increased between then too . Most of the people who spend alot of time on the computer do not interact with their friend and family much . This can lead to ruined relationships , loss of friends and the chance of losing your love with family . Many experts , such as @ PERSON2 , say that a person can become depressed from not interacting with friends and family . He also says some of the people who became depressed start thinking of suicide .

8459,437,1,"@ ORGANIZATION1 , In my opinion , the effects of computers are not good . Many people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising . People are on their computers so much that they do not enjoy nature anymore . Also , they are not interacting with family and friends that much . I think that computers are becoming an issue . @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 people in my school agree that they hardly exersize any more because they are always on their computers . For example , @ NUM3 year old @ CAPS1 used to go to the gym everyday before she got her own computer . Now every afternoon she finds herself in front of the computer monitor . If it was not for computers , I am sure kids would be outside getting exersize . Computers are a serious issue . Have you ever found yourself in front of the computer screen , on a beautiful day outside ? I have , and while I was on the computer I could have been outside enjoying nature . I think it would be best if you unplugged those computers for a day and just went outside and got some fresh air ! If everybody keeps this habit of staying on your computers all day and not going outside , we might turn into a world of couch potatos ! I am sure you do not want that . Lastly , I remember multiple times I said I would do something with my dad but I did not because I was on the computer . Many people can agree with me . Instead of going out to interact with your friends many are just instant messaging them . The internet is amazing , but I think everyone forgot the joy of going out with friends and family . So get off those computers and call a friend . In conclusion , the effects of computers are bad . Many people are spending too much time on their computers and have less time exersising . They are on so much they do not enjoy nature anymore . Also , they are not interacting with friends and family .

However , some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer instead of excercising , or taking a walk . I think that computers are an important part of a persons life because the information found on a computer is very useful . It can be useful to you when you have a report coming up . What if your teacher tells you that a report is due tomorrow ? What are you going to do , you do not have time to go to the library . I would go on the computer and get all the information I need . I would also use a computer to learn about far away places , or even famous people in history . I also could look up where I am going on vacation and then I could learn more information about it . Like , you could find where the best resturant locations are , the best holers , and even the best tourist spots . Computers are also helpful for chating . My grandparents moved so I do not talk to them that much anymore , but since I have a computer I can send a quick e - mail saying hi , or asking how they are doing . Also imagine going to work and not having a computer ! that is a lot of work to write down ! At some works , the work consists of emailing other work members about the problems they are having , and about meetings . By using a computer you can keep up to date on everything that is going on . Also computers are helpful because if you had a test to study for , and you forgot your notes at school , you can look up online what you are studying . Then you can study from the computer . So then the next day you will not fail the science test . Computers can be a nice little break after all your homework is done . If you want to go on the computer to talk to your friends , it should be an insentive to get all your homework done first . Sometimes people need some down time after all their homework is over with . Playing games on the computer can be a nice way to relax .

8474,1500,1,"Dear local Newspaper editor , More and more people are using computers , but not everyone thinks that is such a good idea . Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people . Other experts disagree . I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because they let you learn about anything all over the world , they let you talk online with other people , and teach hand eye coordination . I think that computers are very helpful . do not you love having the oppritunity to research anything from any part of the world that you want to learn about ? I am sure that everyone who has a computer does . With computers , you can use search engines like , google , yahoo , ask , and so many more . I know that computers help me with research all the time when I do projects or write papers for school . The internet is a great , reliable that you cango to when researching a topic for shcool or even just looking for an answer to a simple question . My next reason is that computers let you talk to other people online . Things like facebook , email , myspace , and web - caming all let you communicate with people anywhere in the world . For example , I have an aunt that lives in @ LOCATION1 , and on christmas me and my family used my cousins webcam to see her and talk to her when we could not be with her on a special holiday . Also , things like facebook and myspace let you put up pictures and chat with friends and family all over the world . My last reason why I think computers have a positve effect on people is that playing on the computer is a good leisure time activity . There are all kinds of fun games you can play , and some even let you compete with other people around the world . For example , internet checkers is a game that lets you compete against someone else . There are so many websites that let you pick games you want to play out of a huge selection . it is obvious that computers have a positive effect on people for research , talking to friends & family and leisure activities .

8479,773,1,The effects of computers to people are that adults and kids are getting way more attention then they need to . The first reason why is that most spend their time social networking . The others are either buying things or playing games . Some of the people that are on the computers are wasting too much time being tech - saavy . it is other ways people can spend their time like biking or taking a brisk walk . Another solution is you can get up on you learning skills or find a job around you town . Computers drain and waste peoples minds everyday . I think it is essential for the people that can not get off seek fitness and mental health . Than again it could be legitimate reasons to be on the computers spending as much time as you want . The people that abuse the access of their computer too much should think and find something else to do . I think it will be a good idea to have a time when the computers should be shut off one day or a week . By that I mean the cable / enternet company should turn the internet and the cable off for a week of pure exercise . that will make people who are lazy to do something active . it will also be a good motivator for people who are on the computer or watching t . v too much . Then it would make everybody fit and health if they try . I understand the elderly or senior citizens who need their computers for health help . that is understandable but everyone else should not be exempt . Computers and laptops should be network disconnected to make people get off their feet and do something helpful or brain building . Everyday people are being digitally sucked in . Some people in this world just can not get enough of it and it need to dead soon . The government should make a legal law that you must do something that will actively benefit you . It should be a person of the state or local towns person that goes to every house . Another way that could be done is by one person from every street in the state go home - to - home to make sure the procedure is being done . A lot of people are not going to like it and they will not obey the new law . It should be a penalty towards anyone that fails to abide by it . The second choice should be a loss of internet services . that will make them really mad and in exchange they should still exercise . Sometimes it takes harsh laws to make somebody change .,8.0,203,4.753714923586114,15.10344827586207,29,0.4624145785876993,6.0,1.5170842824601367,1.3610156764620027,0.002277904328018223,29.0

"" I love facebook , because I can keep in touch with my family members in the @ LOCATION1 , "" says @ PERSON2 . Also , researchers say that people who have facebook , skype , or twitter accounts become closer to their families than people who do not . A computer can be used for educational purposes also . Many people like to use educational computer games to prepare their elementary - schoolers for school . "" @ CAPS1 ' s fun and gets my son prepared ! "" says a local mother as she talks about a computer game . Studies show that computer games are @ PERCENT1 better at preparing a child for school than textbooks and worksheets . One of everyone ' s favorite reasons for keeping a computer in the house is for entertainment . When on a computer , anyone can play cards , chess , pinball or game websites like addictinggames . com , go on youtube . com to watch videos , or much much more . "" I like to spend some of my free time on addictinggames . com , "" says @ PERSON1 . Also , after taking a poll . I found out that @ PERCENT2 of kids and teens prefer online games to board games . As you can see , there are many reasons why having a computer in the house is important . There are also many more than what I listed . However , I think the main ones are to keep in touch with friends and family , to use the computer for educational purposes , and for entertainment . I am very grateful for the computer in my house because I use @ CAPS1 everyday for those purposes , and so does everyone else in my family . A computer is one of the most important things in the average home .",8.0,176,4.511349281620037,14.653846153846152,26,0.4607329842931937,6.0,1.6596858638743457,1.5262349099495225,0.015706806282722512,26.0
8506,843,1,"Alot of people would disagree that computers are benefiting people .

Computers are a very good way to learn because on a computer you could easily find out whi the @ CAPS1 of @ LOCATION1 is . But if you did not use a computer and you went to a library it could take hours to find the right and find were in the book it is . You could also learn about news faster without writing for it to come on the news channel . Computers are a lot beter than having to drive to a library because with just a couple as clicks you could find what you want and be done . Computers are also fun because you can play little games on the internet that could easily take up on extra @ NUM1 minutes that yu might have on a work break or before school . And even some games exercise your mind like solitare it is fun but hard . But there are some games that people tend to over do because they go addicted . But most people have not ever prayed a game like that or only play once in a while . Lastly computers are a good way to stay in touch with old friends because there are a lot of ways to talk to people online like say if when you were in high school your best friends moved away you sould still talk to people on a chat room were you can text . or a video chat were you actualy see them face to face .

8510,1782,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , I believe that computers are a good source of technology . The reasons which I am fighting for tell why , kids are in school more than half of the school day . Parents should be limiting there childrens use and what they do , and computers are a way of contact and research . To begin , kids are in school more than have of a school day . How could children stay on the computer when there in school learning ? They can not . In school you get alot of exercise because your always movign around . After school kids usually do homework or go out with friends . Computers do not have effect on people , if anything it makes them smarter . Secondly , if children have a computer at home their parents should be limiting the time and what exactly they could do on the computer . The people who support advances in technology are correct , computers open up imagination , and learning . Parents of the children that have computers should be more worried than anyone else and if they are , they should just take the computer away . Parents sould also take their kids places more often so the schild win not have to go online . Lastly , computers are a way of contacting others . If you do not have a phone , you use a computer to go on your email , or personal websites . Also poeple need computers for schol work and for their jobs too ! Another thing numerous peopel use a computer for is research and reports . We need our information ! To conclude , my thoughts are very important to consider because , mny other people would be shy to wirte this and get it published in their local newpaper ! I would like to say computers are not interacting with family , friends , nature or anything of that sort . We as a whole need computers to do daily life things , without be able to go online , or save files we would be lost ! So I will say again to consider my ideas .

Also people will have the ability to learn about different states and countries . I ask people would be able to interact with their family and friends from different towns . Those are all the reasons why I think computers are a good use . The first reason why I think people should use computers is it will teach people to have hand - eye coordination . People will know how to stay focussed with their eyes and also know how to also use their hands all at the same time . To stay focussed with their eyes people would have to wear glasses for the light . Also so when they are typing they will not have to keep looking down all the time .

It is easier to use them , when you are going on vaction because you can check out how much hotels are , where resteraunts are , and what interesting places are there , instead of calling / driving around .

We need computers for life , and that doesn ' @ CAPS1 make use lazy and forget full it makes us busy . The only situation with someone who is online being lazy is with a teenager playing games . But the only reason some kids do that is because they all do not want to go and exercise or run around with their family who they see everyday . But because they want to talk to their friends make plans and just talk while they play togeather . If someone is ignoring their family or becomeing more lazy , it is because that is their choice to sit around and do nothing . And I do agree that people are becomeing over weight but I think that is because some people consider a workout to be an hour of lifting and running once a week . And that isn ' @ CAPS1 right . I think that this news paper should post up adds about gyms and maybe that will lower the faty meter in our town . or if they think people are neglecting their families have people work less so they can go home and see their families .

My first reason why people should spend less time online is because people need to exercize . Seriously people should be taking walks around the block or going to the gym or even playing a sport instead of playing on the computer all day and doing nothing and without exercising you will become overweight and lazy .

8571,924,1,"Dear Newspaper , Some people are asking others about the effects computers have on other people . Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising , enjoying nature , and interacting with family and friends . But my opinion is that the comuter is great and it does not keep people away from other activitys . First , the computer does not keep people away from other activitys because , there are @ NUM1 hours in a day , and it is that persons folt if they do not get off the computer , and go do other activitys . Even though the computer has lots of things , and it is very interesting . people . Should still have the common since to get off nad go do other things , so I think it is there fult if they do not get off the computer . Also there are a lot of reasns that people do not get out and do other activitys , so why just stop computers . Secondly , the computer does not keep people away from other activitys , because there are lots of destration that keep people away from other activitys , so why blame computers . For example the television keeps people from doing other activitys , but their not talking about stop that . Also the computer teaches you about a lot of thngs , an can so you a lot of things that you do not know about and is trying to find out . For example your family ' s history , you could go look that up on the computer . Lastly , the computer does not keep people away from other activitys , because if people were really worried about there other activitys then they would get off the computer and go do what they had to do . For example if they had to go to the gym then they should get off the computer , and go to the gym because the computer does not make you fat , you make yourself fat , so the should be resonable enough to go to the gym , and not be on the computer all day . Also if you were going to spend time with your family the how could the computer stop you from doing that , you should already know what you need to do and I do not think the computer would make you forget things like that . So it would be the person ' s fult if they forget not the computers . To rap this up , computers does not keep people away from other activitys , because it is there responablity to remeber what they need to do not the computers and there are lots more destrations then computers , but it is still not computer ' s falty it yours .",8.0,145,3.8788301738011803,26.235294117647058,17,0.3243847874720358,5.0,1.5369127516778522,1.0863128407412879,0.02237136465324385,17.0

You can @ CAPS3 reconnect woth old friends that you have not sen in years , learned many good things with the internet and computers . First off we would not be able to do some of the things we do without computers . @ CAPS1 us school projects , I use @ ORGANIZATION1 word and powerpoint all the time . Our teachers prefer us to do that instead of handwriting evert thing . Getting information on the computer is so much faster and easier I mean the time it would take , you to look up the word "" elephants "" the encyclopedia is probably @ NUM1 times more that it takes to it in can google . Plus there about @ NUM2 1 / @ NUM2 seconds google call all up millions of websites just what "" elephants "" .

8580,1127,1,"The use of computers has been increasing since personal computers were invented . Although there are some upsides to computers like doing research and interacting with people , there are @ CAPS1 more bad aspects then good ones when it comes to computers . Computers negatively affect the way people live outside the "" virtual world . "" @ CAPS1 people end up overweight or obeise from spending too much time in a computer chair and not enough time outside exercising . People also tend to interact with people on the computer that they do not talk to out in the world , or that they do not know at all . People also give out personal information to people they do not know , which leads me to my second point . Thefts happen everyday across the globe , whether it is robbing a bank , a store , or even someone ' s identity . Using a computer can lead to @ CAPS1 thefts . There are people that hack into people ' s banking account , which has all your personal information on it , and withdraw any sum of money tha they like . Millions of people have all of their information online , for anyone to see , and this is very dangerous . That is another downside to computers . My final point that is to be made is all the costs that come with computers . @ CAPS1 people have to spend a lot of money on glasses because they looked at a computer nearly all the time . Some people even must pay for rehab . There are people out there who are actually addicted to the internet , so they have to pay thousands of dollars to get back to health .

Here are some good reasons on why computers help people out with problems . First of all , computers give you information on things that you cannot find in books . People can look up places for vacations , what their child ' s grade in school is , and find healthy food recipies . Without the computers people would be lost not knowing what to do . Next , computers let you talk to friends . You can discuss things like weather , ideas you have , you can even plan exercise days . What if something important happens ? The person does not have his or hers phone . What could they do ? They could go on the computer and tell their friend . It would be a lot easier than driving over to the persons house then driving driving all the way back . Finally , computers can give you a good sense of hand eye cordination . Computers can teach you how to type without even looking at the keyboard . This skill could be used to pursue a good career in the carpentry field . Computers can also help you study for a new job and what the requirements are . In conclusion , I believe that computers make peoples a little bit easier knowing that they have vital information right at the tips of their fingers . It can also help them in anything they want to do .

8610,1688,1,"Dear Local newspaper , I have concerned because lately a lot of people have been using computers alot . My concern is that they have not been exercising much , they are not enjoy nature and they are not spending much time with their family . This is not a posiitve way for their life . In my opinion excercising is a very , very , very important thing to do . This is because you need to mantain a healthy diet to stay healthy and you need to excersise . Some people I know do not exercise and they are either overweight or not healthy . People are "" busy "" , as they say , uisng the computer to do all there work because they just do not like using the old fashion way , which is going to your job and doing your work . Everything is different now and people have become lazyier than ever before . Would people be lazy , if computers weren ' t around ? Of course they would not be . They would have a happy healthy life . Now - a - days , people do not go out and explore the world much they just go online and nthey search a place up on a google . They do not see the real thing though . they see pictures and everybody knows that seeing the real thing is way , way better than looking at a picture . But i guess everyone forgot about that . Computers have everything online , no wonder poeple do not want to leave their homes and if they do leave , don "" t worry they have a laptop with them . Computers are even portable go wherever they go their still going to go online . Poeple have also spent less time with family because they could talk to them online in a s chat room .

8611,451,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , I believe that people should be able to go on the computers and still be doing it . For a good reason such as communicating with far away relatives . Another reason is , if you need a @ ORGANIZATION1 work - out or healthy eating tips , you can just print them out . And my last reason is if you are going on a far away trip but you do not know the way , you can just print out directions ( @ ORGANIZATION2 ) . Say if you have a relative that lives all the way in @ CAPS1 but you can not call them because you live all the way in the @ LOCATION1 And if you call them , it will cost you about @ MONEY1 per minute . What you can do is you can contact them over the computer ( webcam ) . And it is way better than just calling them because you can actually see them .

Or you can also do fitness lessons while watching them off of your computer . And if you are on a diet , you can look up @ ORGANIZATION1 healthy recipes . You can also get @ ORGANIZATION1 work - out equipment that will make ( or keep you ) , nice and slim . My last reason is that if you are going on a long journey away from home you need to now the way . But , what if you do not know the way ? You can go on the internet and look up directions . And that is way better because at least you are not wasting money on a @ MONEY2 @ ORGANIZATION3 . And it is more and quicker . And the best part is that you do not have to keep looking at the @ ORGANIZATION3 and program stuff . With the maps on the computer , you can print it out and actually keep it .

8617,862,1,"Dear @ PERSON1 editor , I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects , but more positive . For example , when people get home from work or school , they immedlatly go on the computer , to check email , do work , or to play games . I think that it is good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we can not see , but too much of it will be bad . I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you are on it too much , I think it is good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day , but also spend time outside with family and friends . The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn . I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I will be on facebook , facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand - eye coordination , when projects came along I usually do all my research there , picking up information on each site . I also do all the writing on it too so it will not look messy but instead , clean and neat . The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t . v . and otherwise , like youtube or google videos . The computer lets me see nature , talk to friends and family , and lets me see things , like videos , that twill never ever see in books . These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste . The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to . People say that you do not get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work , which is enough exercise for the day . Computers are a nice device to have and are by far , used daily by almost everyone . So it can not be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway . The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings . I hope you see my point of view .",8.0,174,3.8747106116711088,22.66666666666667,18,0.4254278728606357,5.0,1.530562347188264,1.5002723456084084,0.004889975550122249,18.0

One of the best things about computers is that you can find various amounts of information . That opition is useful for children that attend school , looking to find information for a certain project they need to finish . You can also use the information on the computer to study if your textbook is not doing you only good . Also if a student is looking for a job in their local area they look on the internet for jobs needing employees . Computers also can be used for communication . You could have a long lost realtive you have not spoken to in a while , you can easily find him on the internet . Online communicating is also good for chatting with schoolmates if you forgot the homework or need help with homework . I am not a big fan of this but online chatting can be use for online dating if your to lazy to go out .

8650,536,1,"Dear Newspaper @ CAPS1 , Even though there are good effects of computers on people , there are also many bad effects . Some of the major bad effects of computers on people are no exercise , you can talk to strangers , and no interaction with family and friends . One of the effects of computers on people is no exersise . One of the most important effect of computers on people is no exersise . Right now many people in the @ LOCATION1 are obese because of bad eating and no exersise . One of the problems is that these people don ' @ CAPS2 get off their computers and couchs to go outside . These people choose to stay indoors and just do nothing except watch @ CAPS2 . V . and go on the computer . So computers have a big effect on how these people live their lives . Another problem caused by computers is kids talking to strangers . Most kids in the @ LOCATION1 are a member of a social network like @ CAPS3 or @ CAPS4 . There are people out there that go on these websites on their computers and pretend to be a teen . This can get many kids in trouble if they are not careful on these websites . Since most people access these websites from their computers it is another bad effect of computers on people . Another bad effect is no iteraction with family or friends . When people are on computers , they focus on what is on the computer and not about their surroundings . Being on the computer stops many people from interacting with their family and friends . Not interacting with anyone causes their social skills to weaken since they are always on the computer . This can become a serious problem if a person becomes too adicted to the computer .

8652,1626,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 have come very far with technology . Computers and other gadgets have helped us go farther . But the computer is one gadget that does not benefit society . My reasons for this are when you are on a computer you could be cyber bullied . My next reason is that when you stay on too long you miss out on stuff like being with family . The last reason why computers do not benefit society is when you type on a computer the spell check on @ CAPS3 checks spelling and puncuation and grammar so you do not learn from your mistakes . These reasons support me in saying computers have not really benefited society . Firstly , my first reason for saying that computers have not benefited society is you can get cyberbullied . For instance somebody goes home and checks their email . They get threatening emails . They are scared what do they do . Cyber bulling , being induced by computers , is the easiest way to bully somebody . You can make them feel bad without doing anything besides typing a message . All you really have to do is find out somebodys email . Also cyber bulling could be anybody . Some one you knkow or someone you do not . computers have not helped in society by inducing more crimes . Next my reason is if you stay on too long you miss out on life . Between checking email accounts and updating @ CAPS4 the average person spends @ PERCENT1 of their day on the computer . People who spend that much time on the computer miss things . My sister always come , out asking questions in the middle of the conversation because she is following and updating on @ CAPS4 while @ CAPS2 are having a conversation . People miss things while on the computer . Lastly , when you are typeing an essay or something you do not learn anything about grammar or spelling because spellcheck checks it for you . Most teenagers in @ LOCATION1 when texting do not use proper grammar or spelling . So they can write an essay in text language and when typing it over students choose what they mean from spellcheck and move on . This is unacceptable because students must learn proper grammar and spelling . This is reducing students thinking levels just above read and click the awnser . If computers did everything for us @ CAPS2 would be mindless slugs quick . In conclusion I think computers have not benefited society . Computers inducieng cyberbulling . When you type spellcheck corrects your mistakes so you do not learn and people miss stuff when on the computer . Computers have not helped society for all of these reasons and more . Computers should be used less .",8.0,213,4.864295145366452,13.181818181818182,33,0.4885321100917431,6.0,1.665137614678899,1.4013517630022396,0.02522935779816514,33.0
8654,861,1,"Dear Newspaper , I know the debate on wether computers benifit soscity is greatly debated but to me the answer is odvious . The internet is an extreamly useful invention , used in all schools and is only inconvient when misused . I am not saying that it is @ PERCENT1 nessary for every house to contain one , but that it is a luxay most people have . The computer and internet combination is probally one of the most genis ideas ever thought up . It is basically any information in a click . Websights such as myspace and facebook allow you to connect and reconnect with friends old and new . Also the ability to create your own web page is greatly useful when trying to promote a bisnuess or company . Not only that but the internet also makes it possible to purchace clothes online without having to go to the store . I know that is useful for those parents , like many that hate driving to the mall . Second , I can garentuee you that almost every school in the country has a working computer with accessable internet . The computer was just one huge leap forward for eduication . These are many websights with a eduicationly purpose only . These are websights like this for children and adults of any age . Many teachers now adays are assinging homework where the internet is nessary . Also tests such as the blue ribbon test are taken online .

First , our country needs to exercise more , and not just sit around , second , we are not spending enough time caring for our environment . And third , we are losing the ability to communicate with the people around us . Our country has problems with being overweight . Most people blame it on fast food , but it is also because people sit around using computers , and do not think about staying in proper shape . Before computers were made , people were much more fit , and healthy , we need to help our country get back in shape , and take our attention away from the computer , for even just a short while , and we need to exercise ! The next reason is that computers do not just have a bay effect on people , but our enveironment too . We spend too much time indoors with technology , and we do not even care about the world around us . Before much technology , people used to plant gardens , and trees , but now that thought hardly crosses our minds . All the electronics these days are making people forget about nature , and that needs to change . The last reason computers have a negative effect is that people do not communicate as we will anymore with the people around them . If we communicate so much with people through technology , we are losing the ability to speak and communicate in person , and it ruins relationships and connections between people , like family and friends , so we need to start caring about the people around us , and not always rely on technology . In conclusion , you can see the negative effect computers have on people . We need to excercise more . Also , we need to help our environment .

Exercising , a very important thing for a healthy body and mind @ CAPS1 have a hard enough time finding time to do this . So instead of that free time to exercise , they will probably be on facebook . Also the maintenance of the computer will take away time for exercising . Just @ DATE1 , my computer got a virus I had to get fixed and that took for ever . That time while I fixed it could have been valiuble exercising time . Another key point to look at is obesity . We should be up and moving not just setting and staring at a computer for @ NUM1 hours at a time . I love to spend time with my friends and family . I mean who does not right ?

8726,606,1,"Dear newspaper , In my opinion , I believe that kids and adults spend more than enough the on their computers I can see how it benefits you in some ways but it keeps you away from halwe , being outdoors and excersizing . It also can have an effect on your eyes in your later life . People go on @ ORGANIZATION1 , @ LOCATION1 , and @ CAPS1 search engines and a little more than half those site ' s results are fuke . And the more people go on computers , the easier it is to yet caught pladurizing and that is a big thing in the community . Those are some ideas , but I have some more do not worry and details to go along with those ideas . People need fresh air , excersize for their body and to enjoy the outdoors . You can do all of that stuff if you just get off the computer . And instead of searching the places online and what their all about , just go visit them . You will get fresh air , excersize and experience . And after having that experience you will pass it on , teh real to ohter people will not get any of hot fake stuff . For example , you can search @ CAPS2 online and they just have pictures food . But if you take visit there you will get to really last the food . Would you rather being sitting in a chair , staring at the computer , or having fun outdoors visiting places you have never seen before ? You will never get or learn anything by pudurizing plus you will get than and get clicked . But if you think a little or maybe had experience with your writing tool , then you will learn and . That is also because kids are too lazy to it out because they are not outside doing things and they are inside and used to they becausethey are so their computer all the time . I guest I also agree with using computers because they give you skills they going to places do not give you . Like , you also need skills , mainley , hand - eye coordination for typing the long papers for collage and those skills will get you for in life . it is like a chain reaction , you type on the computer a lot , you will have good hand - eye coordination if you have good hand - eye coordination , you will do good in school , and it goes on . And you end up being successful . Another benefit with computers is the sales , more and more people are buying computers which helps the economy so I guess I agree but my opinion will stay strong with not using computers .

8764,1039,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , Some parents are concerned about their child being on the computer all the time . Now I am going to talk about @ NUM1 good things about computers . @ NUM1 bad things , and @ NUM1 things on what you should do . One good thing is that you get to talk to people . You could talk to your friends online about something in school or whatever . that is good because what if you frogot what was homework or you need help on something , you could go online and ask them . Another reason why is that you get to meet @ ORGANIZATION1 people . For example @ CAPS1 or facebook . When you meet @ ORGANIZATION1 people online they mostly come from a different country that you never heard about and then you just learned some thing @ ORGANIZATION1 and you have a friend from @ ORGANIZATION3 , @ CAPS2 , or @ LOCATION1 . One more good thing their is , is that you learn @ ORGANIZATION1 things online about anything . It could be a @ ORGANIZATION1 website that you never heard about and something that can help you in the future . For example @ ORGANIZATION2 . @ ORGANIZATION2 could help you out a lot . Now where going to talk about @ NUM1 bad things that computers do . The first bad thing that computers do is that they make you adicted . For example me I got adicted when I had a computer but not I am not we got rid of ours and now I just play with my sisters . The second bad things is viruses . My grandmothers computer got a virus off of a website that website was @ CAPS1 . When you get a virus it sucks you can not do anything or you can not look anything up for school . Getting viruses are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it . The last bad thing is that you never want to spend time wit your family . I know some people who do that like it is not cool if company comes over get off the computer . Since I do not have much time left I am going to talk about one thing you should do . You should have a certain amount of time on the computer and go have fun and do what you want to do except go on the computer . that is what I think you should for now .",8.0,153,4.468856862277779,15.44,25,0.3953488372093023,5.0,1.5193798449612403,1.4619011889093374,0.02325581395348837,25.0

( but you still have to pay @ MONEY1 . ) you can surf the web or have a laugh on youtube , who needs to go out and buy stuff when on ebay or amazon just order and your done , ( but you still have to wait . ) why go to blockbuster to rent movies when you can go on netflix and order a movie and keep it for as long as you like , no late fees , no driving all the way to the movie store , no more of that please !

8773,1537,1,"My opinion on computers is that I think it is a good idea for people to go on computers . I think this way because if you have not seen someone for so many years then you got a chance to see that person or talk to that person through the computer . Computers are also good because if you have a project to do from school then you could get good information based on what project you have to do . I like to go on the computer to talk to my friends that I have not seen a while you could also meet new people and make friends . If there was not computers then we would have to look through a lot of books for information , or go all the way to the bank to check your account balance , this is why I think computers are good ideas . On the computer you could see workouts to get fit we do not only have to go to the gym . My dad gose on the computer to talk to his sisters , or play games with other people arount the world . Another example I could use is my mom she talks to her family in @ LOCATION1 and in other places too . If there was not computer ' s we could not our tests , we could not get information . I think computers are very good ideas , cause it is good when you got to pay your bills too . We could interact with friend and familys online too that is what a lot of tenns and aults do if there was a rainyday or if it is snowing and we do not go the chance to see our friends or relitives . For some people they think it is not a good idea because some people get addicted to the computers , but there is so much that you could do that the computer will not get you board . that is why I think that computers are a good idea and that they are very important .",8.0,129,3.6223987552331782,25.923076923076927,13,0.3816568047337278,5.0,1.4082840236686391,0.3912435636292557,0.02071005917159764,13.0

I think these reasons woul ' d be a good for this issue because every human being can do these three this on a computer . One of the reasons why I think people should stay to computers is because they can learn . People can learn by using computers because if a child is in something like animals . They can go on the internet and look up what they need to find children can also learn on the computer by putting their jump stat first grade give in the drive . children can learn like this . My second reason why people should use stay to computers us @ CAPS2 . I think @ CAPS2 because you can talk to your friends about . They can also talk about if they want to go some fun . For example same good exercise . Another reason why I think @ CAPS2 is if your friend is explaining something to you , that your . I also think @ CAPS2 can be had for other to a and . The last reason why I believe people should stick to computer is because people can discover different things on there these things can be had and some can be good . For example a good thing that I can discover is that if there is something wrong with my computer and I figure out how to fix this that would be good . And I will know about computers and man what to do . A bad thing about @ CAPS3 the computer I can do is bringing up a virus .

8797,1254,1,"I do not agree that computers benefits society . There are threes big reason why computers are bad , people are getting to attached and are not spending time with there families . Others are gaining weight because they stay on the computer , and not exercising . Also some people are not getting fresh air not getting out for a walk in a park . Computers are making people shut out their families . When a girl wants to play with her big sister the big sister will just shut out the little sister and continue emailing her friends on the computer . Families need to stick together but when a member of the family from doing a family picnic or other family activities . Computers have addictive games that a person will play and ignore everyone and sometimes a family member can go into depression because he or she is being ignored . Another reason computers are bad is because of health issues . People will get to addicted and be lazy . They will just sit in the computer chair and eat drink bad stuff all day . People would gain weight might ever get dabetes from the weight . If people do not get the exercise they need to stay healthy then they might have heart problems , and many more serious conditions . If your weights gets to extreme then you might not be able to lose weight because your body has gotten tov used to all the weight your heart @ MONTH1 not be able to take it . At last but not least people will stop going outside and not go and walk or talk , with friends . People should al least go outside once a day to see nature get air . They should go to the beach relax and relieve all the stress from computer games . Having to much stress is bad for your health you might go into depression . Being on the computer way to much can be bad if you sit in the dark not getting sunlight it can be bad for your eyes . So as you can see there is alot of bad things about computer .

They let people learn about what is going on in the world , teach hand eye cordination , and let you meet people online . First , people can learn about what is going on around the world . I can find out what is happening where I live by looking up your newspaper . Other people can find out about places they might go . They can find out what the weather is like so they know how to puck when going places . Also , if one of your employees is going camping they can look up a good place to camp and they can look up what kind of dangers there is when you camp so they can avoid them , because if they get sick they can not work . As you can see computers are important . Next , computers teach hand eye ncordination . Many jobs need you to be able to work we will with your hands . Lets say one of your printers break down so you call someone to come fix it . They must be able to work we will with their hands to fix it . Now lets say the wiring in your lights get messed up . So you call an electrician has to be good with his hands to be able to work with small wires . Both of these people are good with their hands and they could of become that way by using computers . As you can see , computers are important in today ' s life . Lastly , computers let you meet new people online . Lets say you are all alone after a hard day of making newpapers . You could go online and meet new people in chat rooms and online games . Now lets say that one of your employess just broke up with his girlfriend and he is sad and lonely , so she is not working as we will . He could go on an online dating site and meet the perfect girl . Now when he comes to work he is happier and making more papers and if he makes more papers you make more money .

8813,737,1,"Dear ( Newspaper ) , This is a very controversial topic . I am discussing . But on this one , I must say I agree with the experts when they say computers have a negative effect on people . It ruins their social lives , and other bad things . If you spend all your time on the computer , you get no exercise , no fresh air , and you will not get to experience the rest of the world . Not recieving your daily exercise is a big problem . Obesity has already been an issue for millions people in the @ LOCATION1 And it is mostly because they eat unhealthy snacks while sitting at the computer the whole day ! you want to live a long and healthy life , do not spend all your time having your eyes give to a screen . In adition everyone needs fresh air , right ? Going on the computer inside a room is not going to help at all . You need your daily intake of oxygen . Lastly , if you are on long enough , enough , it will become an obsession . Computers already have a bad effect on people all around , and just think about what has just been mentioned . Another problem computers have is that they keep you away from your family and friends . As mentioned before , the social life you had will be gone . With that in mind , people will always see you on the computer , and eventually get sick of you . Computers bring no adventures , just pictures of them . Going out into the real world might be hard , but it is something that should be done . a real life cannot be lived in a dark room with no people or no nature . have not you always wanted to travel around the world , see different types of cultures , lifesyles , etc ? It gets to the point where computer use should be limite , and living your life should be in place of your free time . Using a computer all day will not let you meet new people , and see new places . You will sbe getting nowhere with a computer screen in your face , so put it away ! In conclusion , using computers all the time restrict you from exercising , getting fresh air . Meeting new people , and seeing different places all over .

8827,1143,1,"To the @ CAPS1 , I have recently heard that some people think that computers do not benefit society . However , I disagree with that . First , it allows children and adults to learn about distant places and other things . Also , it allows family and friends to connect with other family and friends . And lastly , it is a form of entertainment on a day that you can not go outside . Some people might not agree with me . However , I believe the computer was not a waste of thought . I think the computer is a benefits to society and the whole world . First , the computer allows children and adults to learn about distant places and , other things . People , professors , historians , and either highly educated people past discoveries and information about things everyday . That means everyday someone can learn something everyday of their life . When I do research on a important person in history , I learned things I never learned in school . The computer is the best way to allow people to put info they have learned for other people to see and gain knowledge of each other these are endless possibilities for everyone who owns a computer to learn . You would not believe the things you can learn on a computer . Also , the computer allows family and friends stay in touch with other family and friends in far away places . If there was computers and someof your family moved to a diffrent . There would not be an efficient way to stay in touch with them . The computer allows you to send e - mail to a families computer or celluar phones . The computer is the best way to stay close to your family even though they are far away . My brother is in @ LOCATION1 and every day I get on the computer when I get home and video chat with him . If there was no computer , I would not be able to chat with my brother . Lastly , the computer allows a form of entertainment on a rainy day . Certain software gives people the chance to create games and post online to the public .

8856,1020,1,"Dear local Newspaper , I think that computers have a good effect on people . My first reason is that some people at college are far away from home like my sister and my family talks to her through the computer . Also many people have an email ! that tells them about sales at grocery stores or clothing stors and it saves people money using those cupons . Statistics state that grownups that use the computer at night feel more awake in the @ TIME1 . My second reason is that if someone is going on vacation or they are moving they can go on the internet and find out if where there going is safe or if they have a nice school there and they can learn about the place and see what it looks like . they can also find out about colleges and see how nice they are see if it is a small school if there are alot of kids that go to that school and etc . My third and final reason is that when people use the computer there . hand eye coordination gets better because when your typing your moving your fingers and your geting the feeling when you use it and your geting faster at typing . Also your not just siting there your moving your fingers and your using your brain . Scholastic kids states that kids who use the the computer and use the keyboark brings there @ CAPS1 up @ NUM1 points . in conclusion I do not think that the computer has a bad effect after your done reading thise I hope you agree with me .",8.0,136,3.40769366424761,22.0,12,0.5132075471698113,5.0,1.5245283018867926,1.280672129520887,0.03018867924528302,12.0
8861,1137,1,"Dear : @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 I think computer are one of the most @ CAPS3 inventions ever . They help education make everything @ CAPS4 and traveling is @ CAPS4 . It helps education because @ CAPS5 always use computers to help kids learn important information . for example if we have to study for something there are websites specialy made for studing . Also there are sites to teach little kids how to read or write . Allmost all @ CAPS5 have computers these days . Some @ CAPS5 even give computers to kids so they can use it to study . @ PERCENT1 of @ CAPS5 in the @ CAPS7 . S use computers more than textbooks and get high test scores . that is why computers help education . A second reason is it generally makes everything @ CAPS4 . For example instead of writing an essay for school and having it take hours than your hand is and to findout it is filled with miss - spelled words . Instead you can type it quick and use spell check . I have never heard one person say that the computer has not make life @ CAPS4 . Another example is if you had to find some information on you new dog . Instead of goind to your library spending minutes . You can simply open up you internet and then search it and find the info you need in seconds . that is why the computer make every thing @ CAPS4 . The last reason is that one . Traveling is such a without a computer With out it you have to go to to buy tickets . In fact I do not even remember what it was like to not @ CAPS9 online with a computer all you have to do is go to the parts websites and then but it from there it is so easy areselfs to places but traveling mail to each other also . I have not sent a @ CAPS8 card in years . Instead I @ CAPS9 email . It quicker , @ CAPS4 and more reliable . That is why traviling people and mail is @ CAPS4 . Over all the computer is one of the most helpful things ever and with technology upgraing daily soon it will be even @ CAPS4 to do things . While too much computer is bad and people souldn ' t @ CAPS9 interact with internet . The computer games in handy almost all the time .

8869,576,1,"Dear Newspaper , I believe comuputer have made a great effect on people in society . I believe this because they make you smarter , they help with entertainment needs , they also give you the option to socialize with websites , and online chatting . theese are things people need in every da life and heres now . One reason why I believe computers benefitt people in society , is with the simple fact that computers teach you things . I mean sure you can pick up a book , but why ? with a computer you can quickly , and easily type in what you need to know and within seconeds you have @ NUM1 million sites that can tell you what you need to know . Computers can also show you places that you have always wanted to see and learn about , the computer can tell you an exact location and information about the area . I know your thinking to yourself . "" wow how cool ! "" but that nothing wait untill you hear what else i have to say ! Computers can give you instructions on how to build stuff , step by step instruction to create a work of art . My seconed reason is computers can give you entertainment like playing games , watching movies , and tv shows you missed because you were at work or doing something important . My last reason why computers benefit society is with entertainment , you can make friends or chat with the ones you have , with websites like facebook , @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 , ect . Making friends or keeping up with the ones you have in a positive way help fight depression . If your always happy on the computer . Therefore you will have nothing to be depressed about . Also if you have any questions at all that you have wondering in your @ CAPS3 ask the computer and it will awnser your questions throughly , and leave you satisfied with an awnser . As you can see computers can do many great things , and what I said is only a few things computers are capible of just watch , computers will be apart of our lives more and more and if you can not use one you @ MONTH1 have a hard time . please if you have a different opinion consider my decisons .

The reason why I think we should use computers because @ CAPS2 we need help on something , we can find it on the computer , also because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone , and sometimes people @ MONTH1 have to go on the computer and check instant mail . Frist of all , I think we should use computers because @ CAPS2 we need help on something we can find it on the computer . For example , @ CAPS2 a student need help on homework they can go on google and look on the they doing and it will help . Also They can go on a website called http . historywork . com and that will also help that on what . Another reason why I think we should use computer because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone . When I say this I mean like @ CAPS2 you have a computer connect with them on the computer . For example like @ CAPS2 you have a gmail , facebook , yahoo or myspace you can talk to you friends at there . I do it all the time .

8893,746,1,"Dear @ PERSON1 , I am sending you this letter on the behalf of the people that spend way too much time on computers . Some people @ MONTH1 say that you learn different cultures and interact with new people everyday . The truth is that a computer does not help you ; in fact it hurts you . By spending all day on the computer you will get fat , lose great experiences on the outside and miss out on life . As a whole @ LOCATION1 is known as an obese country . This is due to the fact that most people eat and then do not exercise . Most of these obese people do not exercise because they are glued to thier computer . While interacting with others they just keep on eating , most do not even know why they are eating . If we want to erase @ LOCATION1 as being an obese country , then we must get people away from their computer screens . It is actually our fault , because we are not making a stand . We must show people just how bad the computer really is . Also , while people are on the computer they are missing out on the world . They will not go outside , they will not know what the real world is actually like . Imagine cthat being an adult and having no clue about the outside world . Also , the could miss out on life changing exercises the kind of experiments that people @ CAPS1 , they would miss out on life as a whole . We only have one life , so you better enjoy it . It would be so sad for someone to just pass through life being stuck on your computer screen . I truly feel bad for that person , then again it could be fixed . All that we have to do is take away the computer . If we do this then all the problems will be solved . Finally , if we get rid of computers we will be known as a new nation .

Not every one agrees that computer are benefitsal for the society . The positive effect and negative effect that computers have on people . My resson for supporting this @ CAPS1 that computer are good or bad are that computers have a positive effect on people . The second @ CAPS1 is to be able to talk to other people on line . The last @ CAPS1 I have is Spending more time with family than on the computer . The first resson that i have for computers is how they have for computers is how they have positive effect on people . The examples that I have to Support this @ CAPS1 are that computers tech hand eye coordination , computers given people the ability to Learn about far way place and peop . The second resson that I have on computers is that you talk to people online . The examples that I have to support my @ CAPS1 are the website that kids us to talk to their friends like myspace and facebook . The place that kid like to go to are tutube and even blogging about everything and everyone . Some of theis thing can be good if you do not post picture or other this on your myspace or facebook . I think that these website are dangers because somebody can hack in to your file and they can try to talk to you like their your friend . The third resson I have to support my @ CAPS1 is that we should spend more time with our family than being on the computer the whole time I have example on want we should do with or familys instead of being on the computers I have some @ CAPS1 of games that we can play with our familys instead of being on the computers , The games that we can play with our familys are monopoly , somy , canda landy card , video games , we can also talk to our family instead of talking to our friends the whole time .

8913,599,1,"There has been a debate weather computers benefit society or hurt society . I personnaly agree with th statement that computers benefit in society . I think that computers do improve your hand - eye coordination . When you can type fast and accuratly you know your hand eye coordination is doing we will . I remeber as a kid I would watch my grandmother type about seventy - five words per minute . Just from her year of practice , she becamr very computer coordinated . My hand - eye coordination is becoming a lot better because I have types for a long time . Scientists say that @ PERCENT2 or people that type for at least four years become better hand - eye coordinated typing fast keeps your fingers quick and agile . I once read a book on computers and an expert said "" the invention of the computer keyboard could possibly be the greates hand - eye coordination practice ever . "" @ CAPS1 plus about computers is that they allow you to learn about far away places wtihout really going there . In school you can do projects on other countries without traveling just by using a computer . I once had to do a class project on @ LOCATION1 and got a @ PERCENT1 just by using a computer , people can look up information on countries for pleasure too . Mu mom just wanted to learn about @ LOCATION2 so she just looked it up on the internet from her computer . You can research schoold too . My older sister went online to bok at collges without acctually traveling to the actual college states . Finally one more thing you can do on a computer is talk to people online . There is such a thing as @ CAPS2 - mail which allows you to write people over the internet on the computer . I remember when my baseball coach was going to tell me I made the team he just @ CAPS2 - mailed my parents because it was the most simple way to get it done . There is also such a thing as @ CAPS4 ( instant messaging ) that allows you to imediatly talk to somebody and for them to immidiatly talk to you back . I remeber I used to go on @ CAPS4 everyday to talk to friends . Also you can video chat which allows you to directly see somebody and actually talk to them physically . I read a news article on video chatting and an expert said "" video chatting is the single best way to communicate with someone without being right inforn of them talking with them .

My reasons being people are spending to much time on their computers , less time exercising , and lose interacting with family and friends . My first reason why i think computers are bad for our society is people are spending to much time on them . I know when i get home from school the computer is all i can think about until i go on . it is like an addiction . People spend all their time on a social net work other then going out and meeting new people . My second reason is people spend less time exercising . I had been over a friends house before , and all we did was play computer games instead of enjoying nature outside . Alot of @ CAPS1 do not make healthy food choices , so why not go out and exercise ? it is because of the computer . I had seen my little brother spend his whole saterday eating in front of the computer and playing games . it is just unhealthy . My last and final reason is it takes time away from family and friends I had spent my whole day after school in my room on the computer . it is like when your on the computer nothing else matters because you think "" hey why not just talk to my friends over @ CAPS2 , or myspce , or facebook ! you lose a lot of friendships like this . Also you lose friendship with you family because you badly talk to them while your on the computer . Half the time I am to busy talking to someone i do not know then helping my little brother with home work , or helping my mom clean the house .

My first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because computers teach hand - eye coordination , give people the abilit to learn about faraway places . @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 students use the computers to do homework . I was visiting a prompt last week . I ddn ' t know alot abou @ LOCATION1 so I whent on the computers and you know what i got to know more about @ LOCATION1 and things to the computers I got a A + . So the computers have a positive effect on people . The next reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because computers allow people to talk online with other poeple .

My family is back in @ LOCATION1 I have not see them in four years so I whant to the stor and get a wedcan and i get to see my family afdter four years . So computers do have a positive effect on people . My last reason why computers have a benefits in society is because computers help to make better technology . Computers help people to make better car , light , an so on . Without computers society is because computers help the soldiers to win wars and even help people to live .

Most kids use computers to learn about things they are doing in class . And they also use the computer to study about a country or a person they are doing a report on . Also there are games on the computer that can help you with math . Now onto my secod reason . You can also use the computer to send emails to friends that live faraway , and also you could use things like facebook to find friends that had moved away . And you could also use a video camera to video chat with a friend or if you are a business man or woman you could videochat with clients all across the country . Now onto my third and final reason . Computers also have applications like microsoft word which lets you type things such as essays or term papers instead of having to write them out by hand . Also there is an application that lets you make a powerpoint if you need to make one for a project . And there is an application that lets you paint pictures or draw pictures . Those are some reasons why I think that computers have good effects on people . If we did not have computers the world would be very different like kids would not be able to search things for projects or type essays .

8934,855,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 , Computers have both negative and positive affects on people . Many people before us went through everyday life without them . Although there are many good affects that computers have on people , the negative affect ' s outnumber them by far . For example , generations have lived and died without computers and it did not affect them . Not only that but many children and adults in this centry are obese due to growing technology . Many people become obese because they were born with this technology and after years , or even days of sitting in front of their computer , they become lazy . They look to a computer as necesity and not a form of entertainment . Even though computers keep people in contact and keep them updated in their lives , that is the only important reason for a computer . As a student , I use my computer for my schoolwork . Everything I do on my computer involves either typing a paper or printing research . I could do these things with paper and pencil and ask people what I am trying to find out . This is important because it shows that people do not need to be defandent on computers when they can do everything they need to without them . Lastly , computers are not needed when we have the availability of cell phones that keep everyone in contact without computer games , chats or profiles . Also phones are safe so they can not get viruses and strangers can not look at your personal information , finding out where you live .

Like if you wanted to see the @ LOCATION1 ' s @ CAPS1 your not just going to get a plane and fly there when you could get pics and information right on the computer in a couple minutes . it is good if you want to see it in person but you will not want to pay money for plane tikets or travel really far when you can just see it from home . Computers have a lot of fun stuff on them like myspace , @ CAPS2 , and games also it is got almost everything you can think of . So why travel when you can see all of it on your computer . I think that computer can sometimes be a little adictive but you got to learn to stay off of it most of the time but it is very easy to learn stuff on a computer . Computers are used by billions and they a great way to learn stuff about are whole world and the things that are on it . It has information web sites like google or bing to look up anything you want to look up . Computers are almost everywhere in phones , I - pods , and even some are put in car like police cars . Computers are very useful to people of the world @ DATE1 I bet that the people who make them will make new ones that can go on almost everything . They have computers in almost every building like hospitials , fire stations , police stations , and electronic stores like radioshack . Your going to learn a lot more on computers than having to travel places and or school . In my mind we should all have computers because there fun and you can learn about everything you could think of so we should all have them .

Having computers benifits our society because it allows us to learn about technology , and how to memorize when we start to type a lot . You have an opportunity to learn about things you like . And @ CAPS2 a plus you can communicate with people from all over the world . Every day you learn something new ! Learn a lot now , and you will be better off down the road ! that is all teachers say . we will computers do just that . Computers can teach us ! The more you use a computer the more you know about it . You can learn about how it is made and the vireses it can have . The computers can also teach you in a way you might never have thought of . When you sit at a computer and type you start to memorize where certin letters , numbers and punctuation are . Now you @ MONTH1 ask what about the little kids ? How do they learn from computers ? They sell millions of games for kids to help them learn even before pre - school . In fact @ PERCENT1 of all kids who start off playing educational games before entering pre - school are ahead . How great is that ? Kids and adults both go on computers . For kids when they go on computers they are doing things they enjoy . For example my brother is really into parcore . Parcore is when a bunch of people do flips , off of buildings , walls , or anything they can find . When he goes on the computer he looks up different parcore tricks he can do or learn to do . For adults they use it for work . They to , might have to look up things for a meeting they might have , or a buisness that they might have to work with . Using computers could be fun for some and work for others . But eather way they are using computers ina way that can help them down the road . Communication is one of the main reasons people use computers . There is e - mail , @ CAPS3 , twitter , facebook , myspace , and so much more . If you were to ask ten randum people on the street and asked them if they have a facebook @ PERCENT2 of them will say yes . Communication is key when it comes to buisnesses and relationships . For relationships like family and friends having a computer to talk from if they are far away is great . Even for buisnesess using those internet communications you can communicate to people if your going to be late . Computers have been and always will be a huge part in our society .

My final reason for why computers benefit what the help , overall in other situations used later rather thab just the computer . For example one way the computer can help in the future , is that a student can research info a bout a subject online and it can help raise their grade on a project .

Computers have a positive affect on people because they help students as we will as many others study , they allow you to access stores by shopping online and computers allow people to communicate . After reading this letter , I assure you that you will agree with me . The first reason why computers have a positive affect on people is because they help students as we will as many other people study . If you have a test or quiz in @ CAPS1 , you can go on your computer and print out @ CAPS1 practice sheets . Or if you have a vocabulary exam you can find the definitions fast and easy on the computer . In the times @ ORGANIZATION1 , a statistic shows that @ PERCENT2 of students in the @ ORGANIZATION2 find computers there best studying tool . They find it affective and fast to use . Last night , I had a test on the @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 and I went online , typed in "" The @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 "" , and found @ MONTH1 helpful cites on it . It was useful and did not waste my time . Using a computer for studying is a very good reason why it positively affects people and makes them happier but their is on even greater one . Secondly , computers have a positive affect on people because it saves people time by shopping online . So many stores now allow you to purchase stock on me . it is easy . with a click of a button and saves you time driving to the stores . In @ ORGANIZATION1 , it showez that @ PERCENT1 of @ ORGANIZATION1 across the @ ORGANIZATION2 said shopping online improved their lives by making it less hectic from driving from store to store . Shopping online creates a positive , less hectic life for many people around the world . Online shopping having a positive affect on people by making their lives less busy is a great reason but there is one last even greater one . The last most important reason why computers have a positive impact on people is because it allows people to communicate with each other . Communication through computers are extremely powiar . With instant messaging or email of even blackboard , a new teacher - student communication site , computers are often being used for communication . i surveyed @ NUM1 kids and @ NUM2 said that computers are there main source of communication . Communication through computers it has a positive affect on people in many ways like to communicate easier for work , to talk to your best friend on e - mail who just moved to @ LOCATION2 , or to simply send out invitations for a party to all your friends . Computers have made life easier for many through communication , making a positive effect on them . This is why communication having a positive affect on people is the most important reason . To conclude , computers have a positive effect on people because it allows them to study easier , saves people time by shopping online , and allows people to communicate . With all the ways computers help us there is no reason why they would negatively affect us . I know that you will take this into cons ideration . Computers are making our lives easier day by day and who knows what they will be able to do in the future .",9.0,225,4.702097035880909,18.793103448275858,29,0.4120879120879121,6.0,1.7216117216117215,1.3416303588849137,0.023809523809523808,29.0

Buying books that you would like to read can get expensive . With the internet , people are able to read almost any book right on their computer . In a recent survey , it was found that people who read books online save an additional @ MONEY1 a year more than people who buy books . People can also read things like newspaper online . If there is snow on the ground , and people are unable to get their newspaper , they can read it online . This way they will know if a newspaper is still good , and continue buying it , including the @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS1 . Additionally , people are able to shop online . Sometime , someone @ MONTH1 have been an accident injuring them , and they are stuck at home . If it is a child , their parents will be unable to go to the store because they will be caring for the child . They can simply go on the computer and have food and other necessities delivered to them . People can also do this if they have a busy lifestyle with work or school . @ PERSON1 , a physician , told me that people who shop online have @ PERCENT1 less stress than people who go to the store for the same items . He said that is is because they do not need to worry about taking much time out of their schedule to shop . Moreover , the computer is a good way to quictly play games . Young children can be very loud and energetic . Parents can just let them play games and read on the computer . Little kids love just the fact of being on the computer , and letting them go on can keep quiet and occupied for a while . Even just typing is interesting for younger kids . For older kids , there are many games that can play . Action , strategy , puzzles , and many more . They can also play against people around the world . The computer is fun for everyone .

Computers teach hand - eye coordination , give people the ability to learn about other people and faraway places , also , you can use the internet to interact with friends and family . Computers can be very useful and efficient to anybody . Did you know that computers can teach hand - eye coordinaiton ? Some computers have programs that teach you how to type .

I think other wise . I think computers are an amazing breakthrough in modern science . I believe computers are ideal for school work and comunicating with others , as long as they are used in moderation . Computers make school projects so simple I do not know if we could do without . Our social studies teacher @ PERSON1 says that @ PERCENT1 of his projects involve something on the computer . The internet is a great place to research for big papers and projects . With over thirty - million educational and informational websites , it is easy to locate what you need quickly and easily . Once you have finished researching it is easy to type your report . If it is not a written report , then there are many other programs for fancy presentations . Take microsoft @ CAPS1 for example : you can make exotic background and texts , as we will as unique animations to emphasize or to make it pop right off the page . Computers are also an ideal way to communicate with friends and family . Emailing is quick and easy to tell others what you want to say . If you want to chat , then you can use @ CAPS2 or instant messaging . This allows you to type and sent emails faster . Both of these programs are an inivative way to talk with a family member that is not home . Like lets say my dad goes on business to @ LOCATION2 . We can email back and forth every day . And now with @ ORGANIZATION1 ( a video chat ) you can see the person and actually talk to them like they are back at home . Computers have their advantages but they also have disadvantages . Computers are great for communicating and school work , but when used in excess can be unhealthy . Here is one example : my older brother @ PERSON2 is a senior in high school . He is in school from @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 : pm and as he gets home he heads straight for his computer . He is on there for at least five hours a night and that leaves time for dinner and not much of anything else including sleep .

Firstly , most buinesses need computers to keep the buisnesses up and running . Like were my mom works she needs the computer for pay roll , inventory , e - mailing the works about jobs , and to look up companies to supply concrete , stone , tricks , etc . Buisness people have excuses to have to use computers all the time . Most buisness people also use computers to plan buisness trips . Secondly , kids in school use computers to do homework , class work , research for projects , or to go and study island and education . Some kids can choose to use the computers improperly but at the same time interesting . Like how cells divide into smaller cells how body systems work or how a girl or boy is made from embrio to birth . In addition , most people use computers . Like @ CAPS2 people use @ CAPS2 to talk to on the other side of the world or you can use aim . I have both cell phone to call and text people that live far away . I use aim to talk to all my friends , I use to face with . So , do not say all people are on the computer to much and for the wrong reasons , because that is not true at all . Finally , altho all people are always on the computer it is must likely to talk to friends you have not seen in a while or for work issues , and for school related work .

Finaly computers are great for communicating with far - away friends or family . The first subject on my agenda is the hand - eye cordination skills . These skills are the ability to work with your hand and eyes simultaniously . There is a number of impacts these skills can make . The most apparent is musical instruments . If you are trying to learn a new song to be played on guitar you must move your fingers to the notes coresponding with the screen . Another place where hand - eye cordination comes in handy is sports . One sport where hand eye cordination makes a huge impact is in football . If the ball is thrown then the wide recever must watch the ball with his eyes and make sure he puts his hands in the best position to catch the ball . I am also going to argue the vost world of learning that is provided by computers . Lets just say someone asks you who was the @ NUM1 president of the @ ORGANIZATION2 where would you go to find that answer ? I do not know about you but I am definatley going to look it up on google ( internet search engine ) . Also schools @ CAPS1 can ask alot more of their students because they have all this information at there desposal . Lastly I would like to cover the communications abilitys that the computer puts out there . First of all let say you have a very close friend move out - of - state "" how are you going to keep in touch . You could try using phones but yet the long - distance fees have sky - rocketed over the past @ NUM2 years . Did you know that if you talk long distance for @ NUM3 mins a day that would be over @ NUM4 a month . in todays ecconmy you need to save money not talk it all away . The internet charges no additional fees for chatting no matter how far away you are from each - other . So hopefully my letter will be able to surposs "" @ CAPS2 ' bama ' s failed health care bill "" to at least make it somewhere in the paper .

Also , more and more ads are on the web for unhealthy foods making these kids more likely to eat more junkfood .

My opinion about this topic is that it is more important for children to do things other than sit on the computer all day . The reasons why I feel this way is because it is important to exercise , children tend to be addicted to playing on the computer , and if someone ' s life revolves around the computer than they most likely , will not be able to live on the "" real world "" . When a child sits at the computer all day , they are not getting exercise . Today , obesity is a major problem . If people stay on the computer less and exercise more than this situation could decrease . Also , it is important for children to get fresh air . When someone plays on the computer they are not getting as much fresh air as you would outdoors . Lastly , who realize the importance of exercise tend to participate in sports , to stay active and have fun . Once you begin to play games on the computer , there is not turning back . In today ' s society , children of all ages , become addicted to the computer . Children who are addicted pay no attention to their surroundings . Also , some of these games might be inappropriate for younger players . Lastly , if children become addicted , they could do poorly in school for refusing to do homework . If a child is constantly on the computer than they have a chance of not being prepared for the "" real world . "" In the "" real world , "" you can not rely on computer games . Also , games will not teach you things that you can only learn during school .

Lastly , when you are writing your application to go to a college , they will look at your records of sports and activities you have done in middle school . When they do not find anything , they will reject you because of your lack of participation .

Technology has helped doctors find new cures for patients , and diagnose their sicknesses in a more advanced way . Thousands of professions require the limitless knowledge of the internet , and computers continue to advance and redefine our way of living . Furthermore , kids of all ages benefit from modern computers . As technology becomes more user - friendly , children have adapted to computers giving them answers to all of their questions . As a student at @ ORGANIZATION1 , I have found that computers are vital in everyday assignments . Essays are now typed and not handwritten and projects are displayed on flash drives , not posterboard . Those advances have shaped our lives , and made everything much easier . Also , foreign places become closer to home , when computers allow you to virtually visit hundreds of different countries . With modern technology , the world is better connected and united . In addition to students , doctors also greatly benefit from computers . Technology has re - shaped the medical world dramatically with x - rays , @ CAPS2 ' s , surgeries and medicines .

That affects a lot of people @ DATE1 because there are a lot of people working on their computer for there jobs and they have to use the computer . Kids are harder because they do not want to do something other than just sitting on the computer instead of when they come back from school because they are so tired , if we limit the time they use the computer it will be better for kids , grown ups , and your brain . When adults spend a lot of time on the computer due to there jobs or checking their email , a lot of times they do not interact with their family or other people because they are on the computer I can connect with this because @ CAPS4 dad is always on the computer due to his office not talking to us or even seeing is .

They teach hand - eye coordination , give people the ability to easily learn about faraway places and people , and allow people to talk online with other people . Therefore , I believe that computers have a positive effect on people . Hand - eye coordination is a very important skill for young children to master . Without it they will have sloppy handwriting , absolutely no chance at sports , and much more . Computers help teach them because they need their finger to hit the same key that their eye sees . And because they tend to want to type faster , it will help even more because the finger and eye will have to work in mission to type faster . Computers also give people the ability to easily learn about far away places , people , etc . People used to have to spend hours searching for a half decent book on a topic , and then find the specific information they need in the hundreds of pages . Now that information is only a few clicks away . Say you have had problems with your faucet , it keeps drippy but you do not want to pay for a plumber . You could easily step by step instructions on what to do using the computer , the possibilities are endless .

9202,1331,1,"Computers were built to help the people make tasks easier and quicker . Since then , they have been updated over and over untill what they are today . Computers are a part of most peoples everydaylives , and essential to most bussiness . But the common question in our society is , are computers really benefitting us ? My answer is yes . Computers do many things for us . They teach us hand - eye coordinatin , give us the ability to research effectivly , and recently , became a great way of communication , @ CAPS1 ' s are definately benefitting us . One reason why computers help us is by teaching hand - eye coordination . In a magazine I read , one expect , ( @ PERSON1 ) said that leading to type without looking is a great way of improving reflexes . The speed that you type is improved with practice . Another way it improves hand - eye coordination is by learning to click and react to different things effectively . I often on being ammused by playing games on the computer . These games usually are hard , but with my improving hand - eye coordination , I am learning how to play these games we will . My father always tells me to learn my way through a computer because they are our future , soon , mostly everything will be done by them with the improving technokolgy , it is impossible for it not to be benificial to our society . Our home computers have been great at teaching me thing like hand - eye coordination . Another reason why computers are great is by making that tough history paper , just a click away . My garndfather always tells me how easy I have it . Instead of going to the @ CAPS2 and having to pick out a book , I just go to google and have an entire search engine infront of me . When we go into highschool we will need a computer to suceed . To keep our essays organized , our research effective , and the clear to read typing right infront of us . My brother tells me that having a computer is the best investment has ever made . Last year , we had a science assignment to figure out how our heart beats faster . This way very easy considering I typed it in and had hundreds of ways to increase my pulse rate . Computers have changed the way we research and finish school works . The last reason why computers are fantastic is beacuse they make communication just a click away . A couple weeks ago , my coach emailed us that our gametime has changed . This does not seem like a big thing , but without his @ CAPS1 , we would have missed the game . My cousin @ CAPS3 is from @ LOCATION1 . Me and him meet only once a year . With that limited time , we can not really get out what we need to . Recently , i bought a webcam and have been chatting with him on it every week . It is almost like he is with me . All the girls in our school can not get enough of me . So I get home after sports , go on , and theres always enough of me to go around . Webcamming is a great way of communication . With all the new computer going on sale and new appliances coming no one knows when it will stop . we will , the question still lingere , are computers benificial to our society ? The answer @ MONTH1 never come about , but at least for me , improving hand - eye , researching being a breeze , and communication just waiting for me is a pretty sweet deal . So for now , I stand by the opinion that computers are great , and extremely useful to everyone .",9.0,283,5.1440319429575965,15.205128205128204,39,0.4764309764309764,6.0,1.589225589225589,1.4514697401811838,0.028619528619528618,39.0

We logged on to google on found our direction @ NUM1 . So this is the first reason @ CAPS7 read the next on . Okay , okay , okay . @ CAPS7 we all know the way our economy is rediculous . Away computers helping our economy is instead of people driving to go pay there bills , they could pay online . Because it is saving money and the state will not have to pay for questions to get gas for the cars often or get re - build . Like for example this gas station near my house is getting re - built because something went wrong with the pipes @ CAPS7 this is costing us all about @ MONEY1 . @ CAPS7 say this is not away we could save the economy . it is about time to move to the next reason . Listen here , here , here ' s my @ DATE1 reason how computers are helpful . I am other known as instant messaging . This is helpful if you do not have a house phone nor on cellphone and you wanna tell you a family member or friend something really bad had happened then you could tell thru by instant messaging ( @ CAPS5 ) because they would surely would get it . Like one time my friend aint have a house phone nor cellphone and somebody was trying to brake into her house she had instant message me to let me know because it could get send to my cellphone . And I called her mom to let her know and befor I know it another massage was coming thru saving "" @ CAPS6 you . "" @ CAPS7 after reading how computers are helpful by helping give direction , save the economy and instant messaging , could you agree with me saying computers are helpful . it is still your opinion but you read minds so think about what you read on say it is not true .",9.0,199,4.447823988243417,17.423076923076927,26,0.4383259911894273,5.0,1.497797356828194,1.5852967004606706,0.030837004405286344,26.0
9265,790,1,"would not you say that having a computer in your house is helpful ? It provides useful information to everyone . It can be used for personal use , such as for talking to friends . If there is a child in the house they might have to search something up on the internet for school . If you need directions to a place or you want to find out more about a specific person , a computer can help you . If you have a child who likes to run up the phone bill because they like to talk to their friends just tell them to use a computer ! These are so many ways communication can be made through a computer such as @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 , @ CAPS3 , @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 , @ CAPS6 , and even email ! If you need to make quick plans maybe for a movie with a couple of friends just send them an email or a message on @ CAPS2 . Now , an @ CAPS1 you can text people right from your computer ! If you are afraid someone might not get the email in time , just enter their cell phone number on @ CAPS1 and a text . it is free too ! Now that our world has become more technologically advanced schools often tend to tell students to look something up on a computer or maybe to do a homework assignment posted on their webpage . If a child does not have a computer at home this will . Make it hard for them to do their homework . Also , if a perent decides to start a business from have a computer would be required to can not up profits and to talk with customers . A computer can also make signs for a business or business cards . Need directions to a restaurant ? Or maybe a local gym ? A computer can help you find directions to almost @ CAPS10 plan on earth . @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS11 is a reliable website to get directions . You can also learn about specific people if you type in their name in @ ORGANIZATION1 . If you need someone phone number but do not have a phone book you can use @ CAPS12 pages to help you .

9267,805,1,"School , family , and sports is @ CAPS5 my always tells me . Kids now a days live on the computer . @ PERCENT1 of students get out of school and go straight to the computer . Students should spend more time with their families , they should exercise more , and lastly focus more on their grades in school . My initial reason why I agree is because most kids never spend time with their families . All kids like to came home and sit on the computer all day . This is terrible because kids never get to spend time with family and do not show appreciation for @ CAPS5 their parents do for them . For example I just want to ask young kids do they thank their parents everyday ? The reason I want to ask that is because they should be doing that everyday . In addition my second reason on why I agree is because students need to put more time and effort into school . Kids need to stop spending hours on facebook , @ CAPS1 , and @ CAPS2 . Instead of going on those websites they should be on a website such as @ ORGANIZATION1 do research . @ PERCENT2 of students that go to school either have facebook , @ CAPS1 , and @ CAPS2 . For example everyday I walk the halls I over hear students talking about @ CAPS5 happen of the computer @ TIME1 . it is ridiculous how many student do not complet their homework and hand it in late . Lastly my third and final reason on why I agree is because student absolutely do not exercise . A famous baseball player once said "" you don not have to be strong , but you have to be fit and athletic . "" @ CAPS5 this meant was that you had to be in shape . @ PERCENT3 of students are not at their weight they should be at because they are obeast and do not exercise . The only exercise students get now a days is their @ CAPS6 . E . class . Even then students get tired quick and get out of breathe because they are lazy and always on the computer . They need to get off the computer and do push ups , sit ups , and just exercise . For example everyday I get out of school I do my homework and I go run a mile . To add on to the students need to pass there @ CAPS6 . E . class . In conclusion students should not spend so many hours on the computer and spend time with their family , as we will as focusing on their school grades , and lastly they need to get off the computer and exercise more and stay healthy !",9.0,174,4.6020299249092025,14.586206896551724,29,0.4103773584905661,6.0,1.481132075471698,1.6111029213053492,0.025943396226415096,29.0

Every school has a computer . Their easy access and very helpful . I know that @ TIME1 year , if someone asked a question and the teacher was not sure of it , we would go strait to the computer . It also helps us do better on projects . I know I had to do a project @ TIME1 , and without the computer I would not have it today . We also use the computers for the programs they have . In art , we made a cartoon , and made it look real with photoshop . it is also easy and fast to use a computer for research . You can also learn ahead far away places with a computer . For example , you can find out about other countries in the world . You could find out if it were landlocked , not landlocked , how many people live there , and facts similar to those . You can also learn the history about the country such as their leaders and government . Finally , you can also learn up - to - the minute - facts with websites like @ CAPS2 . com . Lastly , you can talk with other people using email , instant messaging , and websites like facebook , which allows you to connect with friends . With email , you talk with someone for buisness for to recieves links to @ CAPS1 to websites , and to @ CAPS1 information . Instant messaging is just like texting on your phone , except much faster . You can instantly talk to people and catch up with them . Thousands of people are on facebook . You can connect with old friends , and talk to current ones . I knkow my mom uses facebook and talks to old friends since she moved . So , in my opinion , I think computers are a good thing to have . Not only do they enhance your education , but they also teach us foreighn countries history and let us connect to old friends .

Profesor @ PERSON1 has done a study showing that people who are on the computer for more than @ NUM1 hrs a day are overweight and do not excersise regularly . He goes on the state that if these habits continue throughout their lives they will become obeast and are more likely to die from a heart attack before age @ NUM2 . I have experienced changes in my communities health due to computers as we will , last year I had a friend who weighed @ NUM3 lbs and exercised regularly but when he got a computer that folowing year he stopped exercising and gamed over @ NUM4 lbs he now is much slower and can not do more than push ups . I do not agree that computers are benefiting our society because as people use computers more they exercise less causing them to be unhealthy . Not only do computers less on unhealthy life style , it also causes spend less time with family and friends . Studies show that @ PERCENT1 of children that their our computer spend less time with their family and more time on the computer .

9284,494,1,"Dear Newspaper , @ CAPS1 generation has grown up with the complex technology called computers . I have learned over the years of using them , that they are not as helpful as the seem . They can cause an addiction , and create numerous distractions . First of all . many doctors say that computers cause "" the new depression . "" The internet is where most of this takes place though . For most teenagers , having a facebook , myspace , or formspring is not unusual . I know from personal experiences , that some people abuse these social networks and use them as another way to bully people . So therefore , not only do you get made fun of in school , but now , people can make fun of you in cyberspace . This is the main reason that people become socially depressed . There is almost no way to escape it and all of their anxiouty really starts to get to them . Addiction to computers is also a very negative impact . Many people go on the internet and are so fascinated that , that is how they spend their free time . About @ PERCENT1 of people say that they are addicted . From @ CAPS1 experience with using the internet . I know that there is always something that pulls you back in . You know that you are on addict when you spend more than an hour a day on the computer . Parents always say that it is a self - control issue but many adults have the same problem . They have just started to be able to use the computers , so many times they go through a phase or addiction . Furthermore , this addiction problem would be totaly gotten rid of it we stopped using computers . Finally , computers also create many distractions to students . When students sit down to type their papers they also , many times , have another at the same time . Therefore they are getting barely any work done . Social networks only just make this even worse . Constantly chatting with someone can cause tou to loose track of time . Also , when you try to multitask with the internet . Therefore causing grades to go down or not complete home work on time . All and all , this is an issue that can be easily avoided by eliminating computers . In conclusion , computers do not help us . They cause social depression , which cause people to have anxiouty problems . They cause addiction , which end up taking over peoples lives . They create divertion that make concentrating hard .

Also you can socialize as we will as study with this device . My first reason being socialization . i think that this is a good way to socialize due to the many options . one example would be facebook . This is a social website that is used to connect or reconnect with friends . in a recent poll @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 people say that computers had made them more social . Lastly , computers are a good way to socialize because of the range it can travel . You can talk to people without the long distance fees of . This can range from the @ CAPS2 .

Another reason I believe computers are good for studies in that you have endless . you will get a the . The lost .

Sure some people just chat and learn about that far away place they could go there and explore the buety and nature . I think computers are great effects on people , They help out a lot . I know @ CAPS2 uncle that came from @ LOCATION1 he learned how to speak english of the computer . He learned a lot and we were all proud . Some effects that computers have on people are a lot .

Keep in touch with family and friends and it is good entertainment . First , computers are great to learn about forein places . On the computers you could research a place and look at pictures before you go . If I wanted to go to a far away place like @ LOCATION3 . I would go on the computer and find the best part to go to and I would look at different hotels to stay at the reviews it has gotten . Aslo , if someone were to do a paper on a different country or even state that they have never been to they would go on the computer . Sure , you can get the same info from books but you can filter out what you do not need on the computer . In my history calss , I had to do a report on the state of @ LOCATION2 .

I recently signed up for facebook and I am able to talk to friends instead of using mytexts and running over the phone bill every mont . My dad has a facebook too , he talks to people he hesn ' t seen since he moved heve from the @ LOCATION1 white mountains . Some other sites are aim , aol , and myspace .

I went on youtube and type in "" nike sb skate lair demo "" and clicked on it . i watched it and about halfway through it I saw my face ! i was so exited .

With the use of internet people can learn about faraway places without spending money to go there . Our military uses internet to talk to their family and friends stateside . Also it helps us aquire great hand - eye coordination . If someone was planning a trip to @ LOCATION1 they would check the internet often . Firstly , they would check out sites to go to in @ LOCATION1 . Second , they would check and compare hotels in @ LOCATION1 . Thirdly , they would check the weather in @ LOCATION1 . Finally , they would check airports for flights going to and from @ LOCATION1 . Without the internet planning vacations would be close to impossible . People not only use the internet for pleasure but for communication purphases too . They use web cams to talk online to people in faraway places . It is fast , free , and convinent way to communicate to other people . Our military uses web cams to let the soliders talk to their families . How would you feel if you were a solider fighting for you country and the means to talk to your family is out there , but you could not use it . It is cruel and unjust to keep soliders from talking to their families . Internet also gives us something usefull . It helps us build hand - eye coordination . Hand - eye coordination is used in many things . In basketball you need to be able to look up and dribble at the same time . When you are driving you need to be able to look up and still be able to steer the car . Without hand - eye coordination many more accidents would happen from carliess errors . Internet helps people make the world a safer place . In some aspects the experts are right . We should go out and enjoy nature , but we also need to enjoy and use the internet as we will .

Flip a coin heads @ LOCATION3 tails @ LOCATION1 , @ CAPS2 you pick heads , stop surfing the web to get info on that place ! go fly there and surf the totaly radical waves . Surf the real waves next the artificial ones dudes ! So as I restate , computers might seem okay and i guess they are not all bad , but they are not my cup of coffee .

9329,1413,1,"Computors have definitely had an impact on society that changed the world . People and life are now smarter quicker , faster , and easier . People who live on opposite sides of the world can communicate in an instant , for free . But what effect does this have on people ? Something this big and having such a long history can not be good for some people . I do not think for some people it is . To start with basic , some people get too obsessed with computers . If they have life problems then they @ MONTH1 seek the solitude and privacy of unfiltered and limitless internet . Even if you use a computer to chat with people , it still is no replacement for the real thing . In fact , studies show that due to non posonal ways of communicating such as text messaging , email , or chat rooms , can severely restrict a pasons way of connecting with other people . do not get me wrong here . I do use sites such as facebook to talk to people . So , I am not going to state that online talk is bad . I think it is a very good way of keeping in touch with people you can not talk to in real life . And , it is a good way to help friends and be there for them . it is done in moderation though . Getting information from the computer is very debatable . Some could say that the people being informed is a good thing , which I agree . Some others could say that knowing too much will make our egos so big that we will be ignorant . I also agree with that . I would also say knowing some things are good , but be careful of knowing too much . One once I find computers to be great in is originallity . In a world where we are raised to kill creativity , I find computers to be part artistic . In a way . it is personally helped me to discover what kind of music , drawings , creations , etc . that I like . I can also share what I had made so everyone can see it . Or listen to it . Or try it for themselves . In conclusion , I think computers are a great tool for use in moderation . Some people who are obsessed , it can be problematic .

9335,77,1,"Dear Newspaper , In @ DATE1 ' s world we are dependent on computers . @ DATE1 computers have become the most helpful source of technology . We need computers for so many things , and they benefit society . They can help people talk online , they are educational , and they improve hand eye cordination . It has been amazing how computers help us so much . We need computers like we need water . If we did not how would we survive ? Computers have become the glue to friendships . They help keep friendships when you do not see the friend constantly . I have a friend that moved to @ LOCATION1 last year . It was way too expensive to just call ot text her . So as a result , I keep in contact with her through the computer . Everyday we @ CAPS1 and use skype to keep intouch . Those cost @ MONEY1 per year . If I were to call her each call would cost @ MONEY2 . if it weren ' t for the internet I seriously know that our friendship would collapse . Computers have been so helpful for many people with this same problem . Computers have become the number one source to find information . They have become more popular than the library and text books combined . So many essential resources are on computers . Text books , calculators , and even homework are online . Many people say that computers are not educational , but scientists say it can move a students grade from a @ CAPS2 - to an A + . Teachers say the same thing too . one of my fellow students said that computers changed his life . He used to be forgetting to write down his homework , but he looks online and he has all of it . Now he knows what pages to read from the science book . If you do not think that computers have changed students lives , we will think again . There are also games that improves hand eye cordination . Many sports teams like the @ CAPS3 use this . It has increased there hand eye cordination by @ PERCENT1 . the team says if it was not for the hand eye cordination game , then they would have never have won the @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 . this game is also free online for anyone to use . Everyone that has used it said it really improved there reaction time . The games are also fun and non violent . They have games like baseball , hockey , and hurdles . This game has made a great improvement on people ' s lives . If we do not have computers then our hand eye cordination will decrease by @ PERCENT2 . would you want to be the person to take away computers ? In conclusions computers have made a great impact on @ DATE1 ' s society . Computers are educational , you get to talk to friends , and improve your hand eye cordination . Computers have made a big improvement on how we live , and it is for the better . If we did not have computers then friendships would break , grades would decrease , and hand eye cordination would plummit . We need computers they have been so beneficial to billions of people across the globe . Many people depend on computers . So if we take away computers then you will be letting many lives down . No sane person would want to take away computers . Computers have benifited society in so many ways .",10.0,234,5.467871722906719,11.425531914893615,47,0.4349442379182156,6.0,1.6263940520446096,1.2014051148553606,0.026022304832713755,47.0
9338,1587,1,"Dear editor , I think that people are spending too much time on the computer . Because of this , people are getting less exersice , they are not spending enough time outdoors and the do not spend as much time with their family and friends . Exersicing is an important part of one ' s daily schedued . I have a friend who exersices everyday . She is the healthiest person I know and rarely spends anytime on the computer . But , she knows someone who is almost her compleate oposite . He hardly ever exersices and spends @ NUM1 hours on the computer each day . He has also been diagnosed with diabeties and is obese . These are the type of health problems that are faced because of lack of exersice and too much computer time . Experts say that people should get at least @ NUM2 minutes of exersice every day . But , because more and more people are spending time on computers , this is almost impossible . Studies done at @ ORGANIZATION1 show that @ PERCENT1 of kids under the age of @ NUM3 are obese or at the risk of becaming obese because they are not getting enough exersice . You do not want that number to increase do you ? There are other problems that people face because of too much time on the computer . People are spending less time outdoors and more time inside at a desk . My friend @ PERSON1 spends way too much time on her computer and not enough outside . She failed a science poject because she was on her computer , rathern than outside comparing the leaves from different trees . Doctor @ PERSON2 is a child phycologist and when he asked kids if they would rather play outside or be on a computer , @ PERCENT2 of them said computer . This shows that people on computers are not only young , but they want to be on the computer more than be outside . This is a number that , in my opinion , is too high . Lastly , there is the problem of people not spending enough time with their family and friends . By this I mean face to face time , not just video chatting with your friends on facebook . This has caused tension in relationships . My friend @ PERSON3 did not go to her family reunion but stayed at home on the computer and at the next family get together , she was ostrisized because she did not go to the reunion . High @ ORGANIZATION1 guidance counselor @ PERSON4 says that @ NUM4 out of @ NUM5 friendships are ruined because kids do not spend enough face to face time with their friends but are on the computer . These are all god reasons why less time on the computer and more time exersicing , outside , and with family and friends will make your life happier and healthier .",10.0,199,4.557303969889866,17.384615384615387,26,0.4392935982339956,6.0,1.6291390728476822,1.2957378005380122,0.04194260485651214,26.0

Those people are very wrong ! Computers are amazing ! They allow easier research , I can learn about other countries , and can talk to people online . I do all of this stuff alsmost every day ! We ' re just finishing up a pretty big research assignment for english and social studies . It involved taking a note cards from different sources . Luckily , I was able to go on the card catalog on the computer and find many books on my topic , just by typing the keyword ! We can narrow down our options so easily because you can search for something so specific . After you find your topic , you can check and see if there ' s reliable information by reading a summary . All of this can be done in about @ NUM1 minutes or less . This would be nearly imposible without a computer . I have a few relative in @ LOCATION3 , @ LOCATION2 . A while back my family and I were trying to plan a trip to @ LOCATION2 to visit . We were able to go on a search engine and find directions to their house from the airport . it gave us the directions and the estimated amount of time it would take to get there . I had also been able to do plenty of research on other foreign countries at the push of a button . it is so simple and convenient , too ! My two uncles live in @ LOCATION1 . On thanksgiving my mother was upset because she missed them I was then able to set them up in a video chatroom so my mom could talk to them . this is great , it is so convenient to be to go an instant message . i can talk to people all over the world and it does not even any money ! In conclusion , computers are very helpul because you can learn about foreign countries , have easy access to research , and can talk online . there ' s a long list of other things that make computers great , but it would take too long to write .

9360,659,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , Computers are a great way to learn about the world and it is people . Computers can teach people about things that are forien to them . Computers keep people intouch , all over the world . Computers also come in handy when something needs to be looked up right away . Computers are very helpful when it comes to learning . They can teach you things that most books can not , such as hand eye coordination also about the current populations of countrys and cities . Also , computers gives you the opportunity to see pictures of places and people that you could not find in books or photo albums or newspapers . They also help in schools when projects are asigned . Kids can use computers to find information they need quickly . Kids can also use computer to wright essays or print pictures for projects . Computers are definately a staple for learning & education . Computers are also great for comunication . People can chat with one another on networking sites such as @ CAPS1 , facebook , myspace , and twitter . On these sites people can send messages to their friends a leaking them of something or chat with their friends to see what is to keep in touch with family and friends , on the computer . Family members can e - mail each other to inform them of an event or news . I have actually had an experience with e - mail that was very helpful my family members and I had been speaking of traveling to block island and two days before we were going to leave we recived on email from the owner of the house we were going to stay at stating that all phone lines were down and part of the house was ruined due to a storm . If it were not for computers we would have been in a sick situation . Computers also come in handy in times of need or confusion . People can check their local weather forecasts to see of the weather will effect their plans . Also if someone does not know where a house or store is located they cab quickly look it up on the computer . Finaly if something is unavailable on a store people can shop for it online and can buy what they need , and have it shaped to their door step . Computers have helped this country grow and prosper .

Though others say computers are addicting , it is the @ CAPS2 unsafe and unsecure machine to be using especially when it is left a lot of personal files on it while hooked up to the internet . Plus people spend more time on a computer than ever , missing out on thier families and friends , not being able to enjoy nature and the other simple things in life . Besides , if you want my honest opinion , computers should only be used as tools . "" The fact is many people look to computers as personal diaries or something to save files on or even something to play games on , "" says @ PERSON2 . "" They ignore the biggest fact that computers are only used to make life easier . "" This is really what computers are made to do , help us . It could be as simple as a @ CAPS1 ( @ ORGANIZATION1 ) or as complexed as a super computer but it still only serves the main purpose of making life easier .

Many people might not even know it yet but computer can turn on you and really ruin your life . Ever since @ PERSON1 made @ ORGANIZATION2 the @ CAPS2 popular disk @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 around , people have been using computers alot . it is not because he created the fastest computer ever . It is because @ ORGANIZATION2 is selling world wide ; for buisnesses , small companies , schools , even in entertainment . A few years ago they made something called the xbox @ NUM1 . It revolutionized both gaming and the way people look at gaming . But what is the problem here ? The problem is that because of @ ORGANIZATION2 people are now more addicted to entertainment . When this happens people will start becoming dependent on a computer . it is not that @ ORGANIZATION2 did anything bad but the fact that since @ CAPS2 computers have internet , those people who depend on computers are going to find it hard to avoid being hacked or worse getting all their information stolen . There is this one thing about computers that remains constant . Family and friends will find it hard to talk to there loved one when they spend all there time on computers .

We learn keyboarding skills . @ ORGANIZATION3 techniques and how to research any topic . @ ORGANIZATION1 , itself has influenced computer use . If we could travel back in time , we would most likely see kids hanging around the streets . Now - a - days , kids spend a lot @ ORGANIZATION2 time inside , on the computers . This is not necessarily a bad thing . I bet you , or your parents , or maybe even your grandparents used to hear @ ORGANIZATION2 gangs or fights going on in the streets . Now that computers have become an important item in many people ' s lives you do not hear those types @ ORGANIZATION2 things as much .

These includes that computers improve hand - eye coordination , provide abundant information , and allow people to talk online . As said earlier , using a computer can improve hand - eye coordination . In fact , it is known that computers can immensely improve your reflexes .

I believe that computers have a positive effect on people . Computers allow people to talk with others online , have the ability to educate in certain areas , and teach hand - eye coordination . Who says the only way to contact or communicate with someone is through letters or the phone ? The technology brought upon using computers allows people to talk online with others in a fast , easy , enjoyable way . Have a question that you have to ask a friend , but someone else is using the phone ? Write a letter ! Oh wait , letters can take up todays and your question is urgent !

Computers are so advanced in technology that they can find you an agent in no time . E - mail , websites , @ CAPS1 , and more , are all ways you can contact that agent . Computers are a great way to communicate . The mind is an extrordinary thing . It can be filled with knowledge , and still have the ability to learn and understand more . Reading books is a fantastic way to learn , but the internet has so much more to offer and you are not only reading from one great author , but tons of great authors . The computer allows you to learn about far away places and important people without making that trip to the library . Have you ever heard of online colleges ? They are advertised on @ CAPS2 .

Parents @ MONTH1 think we kids are wasting our time playing games on the computer , but we are actually challenging our minds and our hand - eye coordinatin ability .

Which can cause people to loose time and friends . Computers and technology today have had a very influence on very many people . Spending too much time on computers can cause to loose time and money . For example , my oldest brother was very large at the age of @ NUM1 or @ NUM2 because our computer started working , but this had a positive impact on him , he started participating in sports such as basketball and lacrosse and that he was very at them and followed lacrosse through highschool . While doing this he and saves my parents money . This is @ CAPS1 reason how computers have had a negative effect on people . The new technology has caused people to loose lots of time when they could be doing other things that would them in life . For example , many people in the @ LOCATION1 have half of their day to computers , and not getting the exercise of this are video games of the day on computers . This is @ CAPS1 affect that computers can have on people is loosing or with friends . For example , I used to be friends a person , but then he did not talk to me for almost the entire @ DATE1 because he was always on the computer , which made me think that he did not want to be friends but actually he just deleted almost all of the the @ DATE1 to the computer . Since this helped I have been over to his house about @ NUM3 times this year as to every @ DATE2 . This is @ CAPS1 way computers can change your life . The time has come to decide whether to have a computer or not to have in computers . In my mind I that it would be best for everyone if we did not have the on computers , but if you do that we should have the an computers than put a certain time wait on computers .

9417,1419,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 , I have reason to believe that computers and other similar modern technologie is breaking up the world we once were . Things such as computers are a main cause of @ CAPS3 lacking exercise , interaction with family and friends , and is also a possible danger to ones mental health . The leading cause of obecity and an outrageous amount of overweight people in @ LOCATION1 , is the fact that people spend way to much time on computers , and not excersizing . I have recently found out that in the @ DATE1 ' s the average familly had one computer ( sometimes none ) . Nowadays , the average familly has up to @ NUM1 , @ NUM2 , or even more ! Furthermore , the percentage of obese peoples has sky rocketed since then , because people are almost always on the computer , rather than exercising like they should be . A major reason that modern technologie has hur t our nation , is that there is an immence lack of communication and interaction between families . Families are fighting / arguing more often , and spouses getting in divorces because they never get to spend time together . Studies have shown that nowadays @ NUM3 of @ NUM1 marages ends in a divorce , where as in @ DATE2 , it was @ NUM3 of @ NUM6 . Advances in technologie have astoundingly increased since then , and people are on the computer / phones / other @ CAPS4 which is separating families everywhere . When impubesent children are trying to grow and expand their minds , all they are doing is sitting on the computer , and not getting the brain nutrition they need . The students in schools today are the future leaders of the world . Now the parents should be thinking , if they want their children to do we will , or exeed their expectation in life , then they should not be sitting on the computer all day filling their - heads with nonesence . Now , computers do have the abillity to be educationally usefull , but do children use them that way ? The answer in no , and , "" @ PERCENT1 of the time , neither do adults "" , state @ PERSON1 from the @ ORGANIZATION1 . I hope you can agree on the fact that computers are causing more bad than good in familes all around the world . People are not getting the amount of exercise they need , are not interacting with family enough , and these computers can become harmfull to the mental health of future generations . If famillies can minimize the amounts of computer - drawn activities , then I think parents all over the world can modify themselves about their childrens health .",10.0,217,4.1160694259108865,22.722222222222218,18,0.5292682926829269,6.0,1.7146341463414634,0.5032583347756457,0.06097560975609756,18.0
9426,302,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 times , @ CAPS2 you think computers benefit society ? we will I think so ! There are countless reasons why computers are both resourceful and helpful . Many citizens in our own community of watertown think computers are a great resource for many things while others disagree with this completely . Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet , also you can interact with your friends and family , and lastly there are many applications used for business . On both a computer and the internet there are more than @ NUM1 million things you can learn . When you are struggling with homework a computer is a great resource . You can quickly open @ CAPS3 . com and search any topic at any time . For example , if you did not know a conversion it is easily found on the internet . Another thing you can be taught or informed about is news . There are websites such as nytimes . com and cnn . com that give you daily news . I personally use these websites weekly . On the computer you can find vacation sports you want to learn about and go to . When my family was planning our trip to @ ORGANIZATION1 in @ LOCATION1 we used the computer constantly . In the end , computers can teach you many things . Secondly you can interact with people on the internet in many ways . These include social networking websites , webchat and email . Social networking websites are a great way to connect to family members and friends from the past . Websites that were created for this include : facebook , myspace , and twitter . These free websites let you add friends , send messages , and post pictures . Web chatting is a way to video people . You can personally see someone from acroos the @ ORGANIZATION1 from your webcam . Lastly , emailing is a great way to inform people . You can write a visual letter to one of your friends . In conclusion , the computer is one excellent way to interact . Lastly , the computer is used for business . An application called microsoft office is used in countless bussinesses , microsoft office word , powerpoint , excel and @ CAPS4 . Each of these are used to plan , sell , present , manage , and write about products . Microsoft is something you should download in the near future . Business also use webchatting , as I previously state , for conference calls . A production company can be face to face with a company from china without being in the room with them . This makes it much easier than to fly half way across the @ ORGANIZATION1 . Finally , computers are used when manufacturing a product in or at a business . Work sites such as @ CAPS5 companies use computers to control their machines . I know that the @ ORGANIZATION2 factory uses computers in their factory due to the fact that I watche the show unwrapped about them on @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 . In the end computers are a necessary item in a business . In conslusion , computers have a great affect on people . The can teach people many new and exciting things they did not know . Also , connect humans with each from half way across the @ ORGANIZATION1 . Lastly , businesses would not run we will without a computer . Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet . Also you can interact with your friends and family , and there are many applications used for business . If I were an expert I would have nothing to worry about concerning computers . They are a magnificent thing . @ CAPS2 you have the same belief and understanding as me ?",10.0,260,5.44984181499845,12.041666666666664,48,0.44905008635578586,6.0,1.7374784110535406,1.3571459035605342,0.02417962003454232,48.0

9439,1163,1,"Dear Newspaper , I strongly believe that the effects on people caused by computers are positive . Computers can help you connect with far away friends or family members , find great naturistic parks , and help you find local @ CAPS8 or exercise equipment .

Luckily , all you have to do is type in "" amazing nature parks "" in a search engine . In about two seconds you should have fantastic results . Many believe that the computer takes away time to enjoy nature , but I believe that @ CAPS11 enhances @ CAPS11 . @ CAPS9 sister loves nature , she loves taking pictures of beautiful scenery . However , she lost interest over time . She said , "" I got tired of taking pictures of the same local things everyday . "" I typed in nature parks on a search engine , and @ CAPS9 sister is back to traveling all over @ LOCATION2 . Lean @ PERSON2 , a nature expert says that @ PERCENT2 of people who lose interest is because they do not know any new places to go . Also , nature in a @ CAPS7 magazine concluded the best way to find nature , is the internet .

Finally , many families today never see each other because kids and their parents are too busy on the computer . These three reasons show why computers do not benefit society . Obesity is a huge problem among the children in @ LOCATION1 . The reason for this is that they are spending too much time online and not outdoors and exercising . Kids are not getting any fresh air or exercise and this can lead to serious health conditions . Parents sometimes do not do anything about it because they they have the same problem .

People say that computers educate people about things but nature and the environments is a big of our lives . The best learn about it and help . Computers the time they are , the earth might become even worse so they need to get educated on nature and the environment so they can . I know from my own experience that computers take away time from your friends and family . Instead of playing games on the computer at home , you could be spending time with your family in the park or the pool . My dad always spend his time on the computer and we never had time to spend with him . When he realized this he rearanged his schedual so we could have more time together . It is very important to spend time with your family because they are such a big part of your life and less of computer will help families do that .

Millions of parents and kids spend at least @ NUM1 minutes a day on the computer . They are either working or playing . There are many @ CAPS2 games and other types of games out on the internet . Kids use these as entertainment . But having an @ NUM2 year old child playing a game with guns is certainly unnacceptable . Kids often get so caught up in playing these addictive games that they do not even think of playing sports or going outside . Therefore , the child loses much needed exercise and fresh air . This can lead to obesity or other weight issues . @ PERCENT2 of @ CAPS1 are already obese , so why keep these horrid games out there ? The last thing @ LOCATION1 needs is more kids becoming fat ! There are two ways to use a computer for good and for bad ways to use them for good can be for planning a vacation , or working at a job , or even to look at a child ' s grades online . But many kids and parents do not use computers for these reasons . Kids have been caught looking at porn , buying illegal drugs , hacking into systems and other criminal type things . The computer is a way to do things that you should not , while keeping your identity hidden . For example , whever I sign - up for a website subscription so I can play a game , it asks me for personal information . It askes for my name , my address , my phone number and other things . So what my mother has taught me to do is to use false info . So a computer hacker or a fraud site can not steal my personal info . And who are we to know that people do not do this with illegal programs ? Computers are dangerous to @ LOCATION1 ' s we will - being . On top of obesity , there have been reported cases of a child or parent having a seizure , having the picture of a game implanted in their eyes because they do not take their eyes of the game . There has even been a case of where a chid went mad and killed his / her parents in rage . Computers turn kids and parents into wild beasts . Parents commonly try to get their children to stop playing certain games . In some cases , the parent destroys an account on a website or takes a computer away for a certain ammount of time . These actions from parents have caused kids to go mentally insane ! Cases have been reported of smashing computers , doing bad in school , killing parents as I said earlier and in some cases suicide .

Special programs help kids learn the necesary skill while enjoying the practice . When I was small , a mere fight years old , I remember typing .

Lastly , a computer is another resort to go to when trying to accomplish something , because there is always something on the internet that will help you . There ' s a famous quote that goes , "" the largest room in the world , is the room for improvement . "" In my opinion , the computers could make that room a little smaller . While experts say that computers are making people spend too much time indoors , and not too much time seeing the wonders of nature outside , the computer can prove them wrong .

Many people have varying opinions & beliefs , But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them . These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members . They let people know what is going on in the world , and give updates on the condition of countries and events . They will also provide information , and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea . A computer is a necessity in todays society , & to go against it is a proposterous motion . Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs . A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there . The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social . Social networking sites , and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer . A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see . To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives . The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives . Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with . Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news . So they check online and find about it there . Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people . It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events . Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster , the earthquake in @ LOCATION2 . Because online news is so fast and easy to acess . People were donating & helping @ LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened . The fast response is what is helping @ LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble . Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives . Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books . They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers . This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research . Now we have the computer . The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics . It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place . This allows for guide and efficient research . There are also websites called online databases on the internet . All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you will not you will not information on . All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing , whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation . The computer allows for quick and beneficial research . The computer has not been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow . It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family . You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories , and you can do quick & easy research .

Instead of relaxing by taking a walk or reading a book , they go to the computer , this would not be good for their social life or their minds . In my opinion , minds need to think , they need excerise by puzzling over something or figuring out a problem .

This is not neccessarily bad unless your whole social life is only with these online people that you really do not know , instead of with real people that you see at school or meet on the everyday streets so what I am saying is that a talking with people online is not bad as long as you put them as secondary friends & have real people come first .

First because it is way better excercising , @ CAPS1 enjoying nature and lastly interacting with family . @ CAPS2 why I do not agree that people should be in ther computer more their doing things better in life . First , becacuse it is useful to exercise . Talking a walk around the nieghborhood of just going for a hike with people you know . Even better going to the gym it is such a better way to spend your evening instead sitting infront of a computer doing nothing but to look at a screen all day and plus exercising makes you stay in perfect fit , healthy and strong for as long as you live . A computer can just kill you not in reality but sitting all day only on the computer eating when you feel like it and no exercise that is what is going to kill you and make you become so lazy to do nothing . I know nobody would want that for sure . @ CAPS1 , enjoy nature live life the way it needs to . Gods creations of nature is the must beautiful thing in this world do not let it go all to waist . Jump off a waterfall or go to the park let the wind hit your face . Make imaginations become real and just enjoy what natures about . Third and last , interact with your family and friends . Spend time with them and watch movies or any sports channels . Go with them for some ice cream . do not let them feel left out or unloved . The mall is a great way to spend time with your friends or family also going to water parks like six flag or lake compound of place like nomads or chuckie cheese it is a great way places to spend and interact with your family and friends it also can bring closer as we will . This is why I think sitting infront of a computer screen all day , first its a waist of time when you go do some exercise or @ CAPS1 enjoy nature or lastly interact with your family and friends , @ CAPS2 why sitting infront of a computer as a waist of time and negative why to spend your days of living life . Technology holds you back from the real things in life . Thank you for reading my letter and hope you take it in consideration .

Because children and their parents are spending way to much time on their computers . People are not getting enough excercise , it can be very dangerous and families are spending less time with each other without computers , so it is worse with them . I think people need to realize that computers are over the humans . Humans especially children , need exercise . But with computers that is not really possible . More and more children are becoming obese by the year . Computers are making that happen quicker . Instead of sitting at the computer eating potato chips , children should be outside on their bikes , or swimming , or playing sports with their friends . If it is winter , the least kids could do is go sledding . Children need to expirience nature , not the screen of a computer . The computer can also be very dangerous . @ NUM1 year olds are making facebooks ! You can find @ NUM2 year old on the internet now . Naive teenagers go find "" friends "" in chatrooms or on @ CAPS2 , and their "" friends "" lie to them , about their age , another indentity . Many teenagers go and meet someone they met online and end up getting raped or killed . There are many sick people in the world , and many of them use the internet to find people . Lots of teenagers give out personal information like their last name , cellphone number , or where they live , and that is an easy way for predators to find them . It puts them , and their whole family in danger . Computers are breaking up families , and friends . Things like @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 , @ CAPS3 , farmpring , @ CAPS4 , etc . are turning people against each other . Some families even eat dinner at the computer . When friends go over other friend ' s houses , they just sit on the computer . Why is it so fun to just look at the computer screen ? Families need to do something together like eat dinner together , go out for ice cream , go shopping , something , anything but going on the computer all day . I will admit , I am a little addicted to the computer . But I do not go on it @ NUM3 , like some people . Instead of eating dinner at the computer , go out to dinner as a family . Instead of online shopping , go shopping with your friends . It is not hard to at back @ NUM4 or @ NUM5 hours of going on the computer . Am I the only teenager who thinks this ? Maybe . But I know that I am benefitting myself by cutting back on the computer .

In my opinion , I find computers to be a very negative influence on yound kids , teens , and adults . Many harmful awarenesses come along with having one . For one thing , people being so hypnotized in this electronical device are finding lesser time to excercise and take care of themselves . Also to , the only nature they are experiencing is pictures online and not enjoying the full beuty of what we have left of out earth . Another negative outcome is that they start becoming more and more distant from their loved ones . What happened to our society ? Why can not we think on our own anymore ? I truely , strongly hope that what I am saying will change the minds of some people . Thank you very much . Exercise is a very key aspect in anyone ' s life . Especially growing kids and teens .

I believe this because we can talk to people in different countries in a quarter of a second , we can send e - mails to other people , and finally we can go to @ LOCATION1 , ask @ CAPS1 question and get an instant reply . First , we can talk to people in different countries . Did you ever have a relative go on vacation in a foreigh country and have no way of calling them to see if everything is okay ? Lets say for instance that they brought their laptops but for at their cellphones . Then , the only way we can contact them is by e - mail . Even if your just happens in you can keep in touch through email . You can even a computer so you can video chat , and not have to wait to get your reply . Next , we can send e - mails to other people . Have you ever set somebody a letter by mail and had to wait two to three days for a reply ? Sometimes , your letter is even lost , and these is no way of finding out . we will with e - mail , the wait time of your reply depends on how fast the person whom you are talking to types and most people I know can type a reply in @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 seconds . I believe that is a from two to three cars . With e - mail those is an eghty three percent chance that your email will not be lost . If for some reason it is lost , there will be a message sent to you telling you that your message was lost and that you need to sent a new message . But most likely chances are that your message wil reach it is destination . can go to @ LOCATION1 , ask @ CAPS1 question and get an instant reply . Were you ever wondering about something and the answer was on the tip of your tongue but you just can not think of it ? If so you probably would be smart to go to @ LOCATION1 . You can ask @ CAPS1 question and get an instant reply . And I mean @ CAPS1 question you can ask questions from wat the price of is in @ LOCATION2 , to what an is . If you wanted to you could ask math questions as we will , such as what is the square root of pi , and what is @ NUM3 .

Computers are great , people friendly pieces of equipment , but as technology evolves , people are beginning to rely on their computers for entertainment . Some people @ MONTH1 disagree , but there are many outdoor activities that are more healthy then sitting around on the computer all day such as socializing , the great - outdoors , and other on sports . Familiar with @ CAPS1 is a great program for socializing but there are many stronger dangers . Did you know that anybody can view your profile which contains personal info ? You do not always have to chat online . Call up a friend and hang out at maybe a local movie theatre . Many people , and I agree , think seeing a movie with their pals is alot more entertaining then playing online chess or any other virtual game with a friend a fan of movies ?

What an amazing place to spend your vacation camp outs at @ TIME1 , bikes during the day , it is a wonderful part of nature and the best part of you a park anywhere in the world ! Camp out on the weekend place to become closer with your family and friends . Hiking is a popular part of a parks and can be performed by all ages , so go out and spend a weekend in the great outdoors ! Not looking at a computer screen . Soccer , baseball , basketball and lacrosse . These are just come of the many fun sports . Out there , and yes , they are certainly fun and healthy . Every town I know about has sport fields where many kids and adults of all ages use . it also a great way to make friends ! Get to know them in person and not over the internet . Daily exercise while having fun beats just having fun on a computer . What are you waiting for ? Stop reading this article and go out and meet new friends . Visit a local park or play a sport for fun . If I were to name everything to do other than use a computer , it would not fit in this entire newspaper .

9565,523,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , I - like many other people my age - love to sit in front of a computer and explore it is wonders . But that does not mean that I spend my whole life on it like others . So I can see what too much computer time can do . It has made kids my age more aggressive , have health problems , and care even less about the environment . More and more kids are falling into those traps . Too much computer time can make even the nicest person extremely aggressive . I know from past experience that when you bother people when they are on their obsession , they will snap at you , yell , or even start swearing at you , or maybe get violent . If someone stays up to late on the computer , the next day could mean that they are cranky from the lack of sleep . This aggression @ MONTH1 cause others to get aggressive in response , which @ MONTH1 lead to a verbal or physical fight , which ( hopefully ) nobody wants . Another issue too much computer time can cause , @ CAPS1 , are even more health issues . Staying inside all day will keep people from getting the neccessary amount of vitamin @ CAPS3 they need which is a vital nutricious vitamin that comes from the sun itself . Not getting enough vitamin @ CAPS3 throughout a person ' s childhood can result in getting an illness called @ CAPS5 later in life , which never truly goes away and hinders people from doing the things they love . Too much computer time also means people are not getting enough exercise , and with the way we eat now , those two things can add up to making a person obeie . Others who do not want to get the proper amount of exercise or eat right and at the same time do not want to become obeisce , @ MONTH1 to anorexia . Neither or these weight problems are very good for you , proving my point about the health issues of too much computer time . The issue I will have you read @ CAPS1 , is how people will become even less caring of the environment . Some of the big technology companies side - step around environmental protection laws to find cheaper ways to make their products and the thing is , no one cares ! No one cares so long as they get their newer and better piece of technology . Everyone will just keep protecting these companies to get what they want to satisfy the craving for more computers . Now , I am not saying that having any computer time is bad . I am just trying to prove that too much is bad for you . That with too much computer time , people can become more aggresive , have health issues , and become even less caring of the environment . Therefore I urge you @ CAPS1 to write an article in the newspaper about the effects of too much computer time , to make it known to everyone in the city . It might help us make a better future .",10.0,233,4.480159999674487,20.33333333333333,24,0.4764826175869121,6.0,1.5787321063394684,1.1431558784658322,0.014314928425357872,24.0
9573,1288,1,"I believe that computers have a positive effect on people . The three reasons I think this , is because computers enhance our hand - eye coordination , they give us the ability to research and find out information about a certain topic . They also allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often . Computers , in fact , increase our hand - eye coordination . The usage of both the screen and the keyboard allow us to look only at tha sceen while typing on the keyboard . Hand - eye coordination is an important skill to have when excersising by playing sports or working out , which is also important and very good for our bodies . If you want in to apply for a job in , for example , an office , and you started stumbling and acting clumsy , then you @ MONTH1 be looked at differently if you were organized and knew what your doing . This is why hand - eye coordination is important to people . Computers also have the amazing ability to search the world wide web . This gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic . For example , In fifth grade I did a research project on @ LOCATION2 . Without all the useful information I found on the computer . I would have never been able to learn evrything I did . As most of the world already knows , there was a devestating earthquake in the small country of @ LOCATION4 . Computers was one of the ways that helped spread the word and get everyone to start helping and sending supplies and food to the victims . Also , if a family is thinking about going somewhere for a vacation , they can take care of most of the help on the computer . They could buy flight tickets , book a room at the hotel , and even get a rental car for when they land . This is what my family did on our vacation to @ LOCATION1 and everything turned out perfectly all thanks to the computer and being able to do everything online . This is how the computer can help you research any topic . Lastly , you can use the computer to communicate with people that live far away and you rareley ever see . For example , my grandparents live in @ LOCATION3 , so I use video chat to talk to them since I only get the chance to see them one every two or three years . Also when my dad goes on buisness trips to other states or even something out of the country , we use instant messaging or video chat to keep in touch . Lastly , if you have friends or family who are fighting for america in @ LOCATION5 right now , you can also use a video chat to communicate with them . So these are all my reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people . They help with hand - eye coordination , they give us the ability to research and find information on any topic through the internet , and lastly , the allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often . These are my reasons and I hope you agree with me that computers have a positive effect on people today .",10.0,234,4.567834420095581,20.30769230769231,26,0.44234404536862,6.0,1.6238185255198487,1.141619525334138,0.020793950850661626,26.0
9576,736,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS2 I understand your one trying to decide whether or not computers are bad for people . I for one thing that computers are turning our society anti - social , we are becoming obese , and there is alot of cyber bullying that happens via computers . You can learn about all this and more if read on . @ CAPS2 a stated earlier computers many problems in @ LOCATION1 ' s social lives . You see @ CAPS2 much @ CAPS2 @ PERCENT1 of our population spends at least @ NUM1 hours a ween on the computer . When doing this they are typically . watching videos or tweeting a friends . This @ MONTH1 all swim like a activity but it is really pulling us away from our social lives . There are many sites that allow you to chat with your friends and leave messages on their "" wall "" but is that really communicating ? In a way it is but it is taking away social skills that we will need later on . You can not get a job by instant messaging a person , you have to talk face to face . But how will we be able to do that if we only email and @ CAPS3 ? Plus while so much you will be prone to using in , thus you with , nothing but a bad grade . Now we to problem that we see occuring all over . You the work on the computer . This activity what , they monitor , lets you at , everyday , since he comes home and plays on the computer and more time exercising . Finally we come to my last issue , cyber bullying . Over @ PERCENT2 of @ CAPS4 teens will be faced with some sort of cyber bullying in their life . When teens sion up for facebook and twitter they are signing up for depression . When a teen starts to get bullied they usually become sad which then leads them grades to go lower due to lack of concentration and that leads them to be more depressed and that could make them either commit suicide or join gangs and / or start making bad . But we can prevent this if we the of time people out @ NUM2 spend on computers . And I think benifit that . In conclusion I believe that is we are bad for society .

9584,777,1,"Dear @ LOCATION1 , Computers are a neccessity to life . They benefit not only the community but the whole world ! They provide education for anyone who has access to the internet . Secondly , it is a form of communication . Also , computers can be fun and entertaining . As you know , education is one of the most important things in anyone ' s life . Where would we be without a computer to help ? Think about how many times you have used @ ORGANIZATION2 or @ CAPS1 to search something you did not know the answer to . it is a lot , right ? I do research everytime I get a random question jammed in my head . Imagine how tough it would be without a computer to rely on when you have no idea how to answer something . Another thing is there are online courses now for students . Some college students have to look up their assignments and how to do them on their professors web page . Also , how world students know what their homework is if they can not check the @ PERSON1 homepage ? I check it almost everyday when I come home from school . it is great that the teachers care enough to post the homework . Without computers , we should have a higher percentage of students not doing their homework . @ NUM1 out of every @ NUM2 people in @ LOCATION2 has some form of online communication program . Whether it is @ ORGANIZATION3 @ CAPS2 or @ CAPS3 , maybe even youtube , or just a simple e - mail , practically everyone has one . How else are yousupposed to talk to your friends after school ? What do you expect us to do call them ? Then wwwe would be on the phone for hours ! Anybody with a teen at home knows that . Also , computers help deaf people talk . They just type in what they want to say and out it comes . I remember when a lady came to our school who was blind and deaf and she demonstrated how to use that special program . Another reason is teachers and parents use e - mail to talk about academics and their children . Clearly communication is a must have . Therefore , computers are a benefit to society . There is no way that anybody over the age of @ NUM3 has never played a computer game sometime in their life . Except , of course , if they do not have internet access . I know I used to play computer games , but they started to slow down my computer so my dad told me I had to stop or I can not use the computer anymore . Woops ! Still , you can use the computer to look up cheats on video games . Oh come on like you have not done that ! Or at least your children have . Also , you can use specific programs like @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS4 or @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 to create a cover page for a project or a presentation for your corporal business . In other words , computers are pleasurable . As you can see , computers are extremely educational . They provide search engines to figure out anything you are ever wanted to know about . Like , foreign places or movies . Anything . Also , we would not have as much communication with people . How would we e - mail friends in @ LOCATION3 without computers ?

The computer is a major help . @ CAPS1 can talk with relitives from different areas and you can surf the internet to learn new information . @ CAPS4 you can playing games with people from ground the world . The computer is a great divice . Almost everyone has a relitive that lives in another state or country . we will you never see them because they live far away right ? With a computrer you can talk and even have a face to face conversation with them . @ CAPS2 can bring your family closer together . For example , my family just got a new computer and @ CAPS1 have relitives that live in florida that @ CAPS1 almost never see . With the computer my dad talks to them almost everyday . Some people that I have talked to said that ther are excited to see their relitives or friends more often . @ CAPS2 has brought them closer together and made them better friends . The internet is a wonder place where you can look up information for a school project and learn about different topics . When kids are doing a project in school and the information they need is not in the class book they can search @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS2 saves time . @ PERCENT1 of kids said that when they are doing a project the best thing to use would be the internet . @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2 helps the kids work faster so they can spend more time outside or hanging out with their friends . Another thing you can do is learn about recent events . For example most local newspaper have a website that you can visit . Even if you local does not you can go to other websites like "" @ CAPS3 "" . They have recent events that happen around the country and around the world . The internet is useful in many ways and can help you with your every day life . Every kid gets bored when it is a rainy day .

I have many times playes games with @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 . @ CAPS2 ' s a fun thing to do during a boring , rainy day . In conclusion , the computer is a useful divice that is benefits us and helps us with our everyday life . @ CAPS2 allows us to connect with family in far away places and surf the internet for new information . @ CAPS4 you can play games with people from around the world . it is a wonderful divice and lets start using @ CAPS2 .",10.0,204,5.129258387395639,14.0,37,0.3930635838150289,5.0,1.556840077071291,1.2090947583763865,0.02890173410404624,37.0
9588,1379,1,"Dear @ LOCATION1 , @ CAPS1 has come to my attention that more and more people are using computers for excessive amounts of time a recent study confirmed this reporting that "" @ PERCENT1 of @ LOCATION2 ' s population uses a computer for more than @ NUM1 hours a day "" . That means people have less time to exercise , enjoy nature and socialize . I consider that the benefits of computers are greatly outwayed by the problems that arise from them to up , computers limit a person ' s health - both physical and social - and do more harm than good to siciety . Spending too much time on computers can deteriavate a person ' s health by preventing them from spending that time exercising take for example @ LOCATION3 , who goes on computer at least five times a week , for about four hours . @ LOCATION3 has stopped playing soccer and because she prefers to spend time on facebook . Instead of recieving six hours of exercise a week . she now recieves an hour this has to @ LOCATION3 gaining weight and losing health . The problem is there are millions of children like @ LOCATION3 who are not getting enough exercise instead opting . to spend too much time on their computers . Another problem is that people spend less time enjoying nature . Now , they choose to surf the web instead . This nads to people caring less about our planet and animals . Nature is very important and can be extremely fun , so this is a shame . Furthermore , those who choose to spend overwhelming amounts of time on computers tend to interact less with family members . No longer do most children help cook , clean , do chones , or spend time with siblings . One mother says "" ever since my daughter got her new laptop , she has not gone once to play with her baby brother or friends "" unfortunatly the same is true for most teens today computers have limited nou , much time families spend together . In conclusion , computers do harm to society they keep people cooped up in their rooms , istead of exercising , enjoying nature , or having fun with their families and friends . In doing so , computers have become a mause to society . Therefore , @ CAPS1 is crucial that people who spend more than an hour a day on computers use that time to exercise or socialize , even to do nothing at all would be better overall , computers are no longer beneficiery to society .",10.0,204,3.9976289777817593,20.526315789473685,19,0.5217391304347826,6.0,1.6751918158567776,1.3779630390761746,0.03836317135549872,19.0

But as these things advanced over the years , they have become an addiction so bad of an addiction it is begun to threaten peoples lives I had been given a choice to s ' de with the addicting computers , or to offose them . The only clear choice is to offose . First off , computers have caused the world a decrease in exercise . Studies show @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 people who use a computer , do not exercise with less exercise throughout the world , nations are becoming more over weight . This is a huge problem in the united states computers are main cause to why the @ CAPS2 . S is over weight and unhealthy by cutting down computers use , we can get our world back into great shape we can bring exercise and health back . Nextly , I am sure you have all heard of online predators . it is scary just to think about , we will as computer technology increased online predators numbers went up . I remember a couple of years ago , I was watching the news and a story came a normal teenage girl , being killed by someone she meton myspace . things like this still go on , and the rate at which they happen are in creasing . by putting people on computers you are putting then at risk of death this is an extreme problem computers have caused . Thus is the last efferct computers have , out of many that I am going to state time on the computer , is time taken away from family and friends . This can ruin relationship in and outside the family . Now I am sure you now many people have become extremely addicted to online games . the more they play these games the more they pull away from everyone they knew and loved computers are a leading cause in disfunctional families . they steal the user away from the outside word . these people need to get their families and friends back . You have to act now , before it is too late and computers have over taken the world . If you know anyone who has fallen prey to a computer addiction , do what you can to help get them back we need to cutt back on any kind of computer use fast .

9603,1460,1,"I have relized that there as been a disagreement about computers the positive and negative effects on people . It seems to me , in my opinion that computers have more of a negative affect on people than positive . I believe tat people are spending too much time on the computer and not exercizing , they do not spend quality time with family & friends and need to get fresh air and enjoy nature . Although computers are a great piece of techology , many do not get outside to enjoy the nature & fresh air because their computers are inside their homes . This is not good because when you go outside , it helps skin health from the sunlight & lets in fresh air for your lungs . In addition , a walk outside to enjoy nature would not hurt either . It can relieve stress & can be relaxing . Furthermore , it is obvious when people are on the computer , they usually block out what their friends & family are saying to them . People can lose track of time & be on the computer for hours . Instead you should use this time to be with your friends and family . Being with your family can make your bond between each other stronger and you can get along with each other better . Also , having a nice family time is a good way to help be with your family . @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 experts say that eating a family dinner can help a child ' s grades & prevent them from using drugs or dropout of high school or college . Finally , kids are more obese than us because they do not get enough excersize . At least @ PERCENT1 or more kids are obese from recent studies . Due to this ; this can lead to bone & joint issues , heart diseaase , lung problems , diabetes and athsma . These issues above are serious health problems if not treated . If kids excercize instead of being on a computer all day , the number of obese kids will drop drastically . Excersize can help kids ' self esteem , and get them back in shape . They can either play sports or even take a walk or run . There are many different things you can do to excersize and it is fun for kids . Unquestionably , there is definitely more reasons why there is a negative affect on kids / adults due to computers for the reasons above and more . Computers prevent people from enjoying nature to get fresh air . Likewise , they also prevent families & friends to spend time with each other and lastly , it is not allowing kids to excersice which can lead to obesity .",10.0,204,4.484620634417258,17.583333333333332,24,0.4822695035460993,6.0,1.624113475177305,1.2069084251518172,0.016548463356974,24.0
9607,1384,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 , In my own opinion , computers do not have a positive effect on people . Online , you can go on any website and talk to people . Most of the time , you @ MONTH1 not even know who it is your speaking with . Plus not all information you @ MONTH1 find is true . Computers also take time away from doing something productive , like playing outside . In the next few pragraphs , I will show you my point . First off , online websites have many different ways to contact people ( chat rooms , blogs , email etc . ) @ CAPS2 , do you really know if the people you are talking to are who they say they are ? Back then , it was rare someone got caught when trying to kidnap a child by pretending to be someone online ; @ CAPS3 a days more and more people are getting caught . You @ MONTH1 think this will not happen to your child , but my friend was being stalked online by someone what they have not caught . We never thought something like that would happen , @ CAPS2 it did . Also , once it is online it never goes away . So watch what you put online , there is always some way to find what you had posted even once deleted . Plus not every bit of information found online is ture . I professionals say that @ PERCENT1 of kids have researched a project online then used a print source and found that information to be false . On websites like wikipedia any one has the ability to change what is written on the page . Most websites @ PERCENT2 give the ability for anyone to do so . Also post and pictures on the internet @ MONTH1 not always be appropriate . There ' s certain criteria we keep children from seeing for a reson . Lastly , computers keep you from doing anything productive . It @ MONTH1 teach hand - eye coordination however it does not keep you fit and healthy . Already , @ PERCENT3 of @ CAPS4 alone are over weight and that is alot of people . Dr . @ DR1 says that online games keep kids from getting much needed exsersize and fresh air , that every growing child needs . In conclusion the internet keeps children from going outside to play . Also , not everything found is what is true or right . Lastly , not everyone you find is the person they portray themselves .

9608,161,1,"Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 , Computers have a very positive effect on people . I agree that computers have a positive effect . They teach hand - eye coordination . It gives people the ability to learn about people and places , and you can talk online @ CAPS3 first reason is that computers teach hand - eye coordination . for example , when you learn how to type , you can memerize the keys . Therefore , you do not have to look down at the keyboard . Computers also teach hand - eye when using a mouse . When you want to click on something you have to look at the screen and move the mouse to click on the icon . @ CAPS3 final reason that computers teach hand eye is once you what to do , you do not have to serch the screen for an icon . You could just move the mouse to a spot on the screen and no what to do . Computers teach hand - eye coordination when you type , when you move the mouse to click on an icon , and when you memorize all of the icons . @ CAPS3 second reason is computers make you smarter . For example , if you have a history project , and you need to know about china , you can use the computer . How many times would china be in the newspaper ? Using the computer can access quick information . Another example is computers can find information on famous people no one knew about . You could be able to find what college a famous actor went to in a matter of seconds . @ CAPS3 last example is that a serch engine can look up famous pictures . If you are working on a project that requires pictures , @ ORGANIZATION1 can have the photos you need . Computers make you smarter because you can look up different countries , you could look up people , and famous countries . @ CAPS3 last reason is computers give you the ability to talk online with friends , for example , you could catch up with friends you do not see that much during school . Talking online is just as fast as texting . Also , you could continue a conversation you had with a friend . Did the bell ring in the middle of a conversation ? we will , you can continue it on @ CAPS4 , or @ CAPS5 . Lastly , you can just plain talk . You could make plans , or you can talk about upcoming events . Computers give you access to talking with your friends . In conclusion , computers do have a positive effect on other people . You can get hand - eye coordination , you can look up foreign countries and people , and you can talk with your friends .",10.0,161,4.754031855951995,14.2,30,0.3770491803278688,5.0,1.6065573770491803,1.5179159574361385,0.01873536299765808,30.0
9609,1097,1,"Dear fellow citizens , @ CAPS1 think if you had to get a book for every question you had . That would take a long time to even get the book let alone read it . Computers have helped the modern world with questions , long distance friends , and entertainment . Computers have helped us with more then those things the @ CAPS2 is sucha universal thing that it is hard to come up with all of the helpful things it does . For one the @ CAPS2 helps us stay in contact with our friends that are far away without talking on the phone with them . Sites like @ CAPS3 and @ CAPS4 allow us to communicate and / or play with them . @ CAPS1 think is the only way to talk with a friend from a different place would be to pick up the phone and call them we will your friendship would disappear very quickly . This would happen because no one ever usualy has the time to pick up the phone and talk to the person and do nothing else . we will when you talk to them on the @ CAPS2 you can do other things . For example if I wanted to I could talk to someone and the @ CAPS2 and clean my room . Further more computers allow us to play games or watch funny videos or any else that is entertaining . On the to do I when my brother would let me use the play again . I was but them I @ CAPS1 went better A also play movies , @ CAPS5 shows videos . If you ever miss a show to watched home of the show and watch it . This could save someone time and effort . Lastly , The computers much more efficient is looking yet things .

9618,1240,1,"Dear editor , I believe that computers are a great and fun tool . But I also believe people can spend to much time on them . The computer is excellent . People can use them to type papers or reports , makes graphs , and other important things for us . Schools are using computers more and more now . Schools have websites for students to go to findout there homework , classwork , projects , reports , and extracredit . The school has even started doing something very new , allowing parents and kids to check the students grade online . Not only do the schools help students , but also everyday people help as we will . if a student has a project but does not know how to start it then he or she can google there project and ways to start it . Computers can be real great and easy to use as you can see , for schoolwork . Computers are not only great for academic purposes , but also for leisure purposes . Before computers and internet , there were only these ways to have fun during boring times in the day . One was watching tv , reading a book , or going outside , if you could . What do I mean by that last sentence ? If you lived in a city , then it would be harder to go outside because maybe you lived in an apartment or somewhere not a comunity . Then you could not go out ; and reading books can become boring after a while , and maybe there was nothing on tv for you to watch . But when computers and internet cameout , people sould play games , watch videos , and talk to cousins or family who live far away . Computers are also good for social networks . Not all familys live close , but are a close family . But in this ec onomy we can not always afford to visit them whenever . So by using computers we can @ CAPS1 them facebook them , myspace them , and even video chat with them , which as I said is great far away family . But at times people can become to obsesed with them . Some people spend all day on one website , particulary facebook or youtube . Do not get me wrong , these websites are fun and cool . But not cool enough to not go outside and have free , natural fun . I remember I logged into facebook and saw a girl on , I logged off around an hour later and she was still on , then I logged in again around @ TIME1 and the same girl was on !

9631,1049,1,"Dear edditer of my local newspaper In my opinion computers have a positive effect on people . I support the advances in technology . I believe @ CAPS1 is a positive thing because @ CAPS1 teaches hand - eye coordination , gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people , and even allows us to talk online with others . In the following poragraphs I will share with you my opinions and why they are the right opinions for all to believe in . Firstly hand - eye coordination plays a big part in our lives , many of us do sports . Now sports is not just about being the best @ CAPS1 ' s about getting better and doing your best . Sports take alot of practice , and are way is computer games though I bet you did not know @ CAPS1 , these games help you develope hand - eye coordination . Defeating these monsters and such really helps you in sports . Catching and throwing is a big part in alot of sports and that is all hand - eye coordination , and where do you think you get @ CAPS1 from practice and computer games . So next time your on the computer play som games and that will be like practicing for sports and will help you devolop the hand - eye coordination you need to suceed in a sport . Secondly , @ CAPS2 in favor for computer use is because @ CAPS1 gives us the oppurtunity to learn about places and people from all around the world . Think about @ CAPS1 before computers if you want to know something you might have to locate all around for a book that tells you @ CAPS1 , @ CAPS1 could take , now you type what you want to know or google and bing theres your answer . This ability to quickly find what your looking for allows you more freedom to learn and spend other precious time doing other things you want to do then take the to locate and read the right book . As you can see this is a ability and can be a big help when you need to know something fast . So help you yourself and use computers make life easyer . Thirdly computers are a way to communicate they can let you talk to people all around the , when you might and usaly be able do . This is a great way to stay in contact wen people move , go away on a buisness trip go on vacation , or even to meet new people . Say you cany get a hold of someone because there phone is off and it is important you talk to them you could email them or if there online and ahave @ CAPS3 . M . you could @ CAPS2 ( instant message ) them . This would save you the hessle of having to keep calling him . Also if you want to see what there doing or where they are you could us a webcome and see them instead of just talking to them . As this paragraph shows internet and computers open more then ever before . As the I wrote above , I showed not even a fraction of what computers are good for . My reasons for computers being more of positive thing , ever a negitive thing are as followed ; they help us with learning things that before we could not , communicate with others , and help us develope hand eye coordination .

9648,1236,1,"In my own opinion , computers are great addition to our world . Computers can help people with schoolwork , communication and entertain you in a safe way . Those are the reasons why computers have effects on people around the world . First of all , computers help with a child ' s schoolwork . For instance , if a student is doing a research paper , the world - wide - web is a helpful place to easily get information from that you can not find in books . In addition if a student forgets , losses , or is missing homework , they can log on the school website and print the paper out . Also , most teachers expect an essay to be @ CAPS1 neat @ CAPS1 possible . That is hard for some students , typing it is neat , and everyone can do it . @ CAPS1 you can see , computers are very much needed when it comes to school work . Second , computers are a great way to communicate and keep - in - touch with other people . For example , if an employee wanted to speak with a boss , or send some thing to him , he could easily e - mail it to him . Also , if friends wanted to talk with one another , the could instant message each other . If a teacher and a parent of a student had to set up an conference , the teacher could e - mail the parent a time and date . That is why computers are great can easy communication .

9650,1018,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , @ CAPS1 back a couple decades ago , before computers existed . What do you see ? There were children outside exercising , playing with friends , and living somewhat danger - free lives then came the computer . Computers are driving the next generation to a dangerous life of staring at an assortment of pixers all day longels we will as ruining any civilized relationships you had . I strangly believe that computers have a negative affect on society . Did you know that as tha number of computers sold increases the obesity rate has gone up @ PERCENT1 since computers came into our lives why ? Because people spend way too much time on and not enough time exercising ! Computers another affect of the long hours spent in front of screen is a decrease in eyesight ability . My family friend , @ PERSON2 had to get glasses because his eyes were damaged by the computer . "" I am worried about my daughter ' s eyes . she stares at that screen for hours on end ! "" @ CAPS2 @ PERSON3 , a concerned parent at @ ORGANIZATION1 . How could something so harmful possibly be good for our society ? Speaking of hurtful , the internet is very unsafe . Predators surf the web , looking for young , innocent people to meet and most likely abuse @ PERCENT2 of parents much been monitoring their children ' s computer usage parents are unaware that the internet makes it easy to talk to anybody in the world , from @ LOCATION1 to @ LOCATION2 ! Monitoring would also come in handy when it comes to innapropriate videos , pictures , and discussions on the internet . It is so easy to be surfing the web and fall upon things you should not be seeing ! Lastly , people easily get caught up in being hidden behind a computer , and say mean , hurtful things that would never be said to one ' s face ! these unfortunate factors cause many of the issues between people today . Speaking of which , computers have a very negative affect on relationships nowadays . As I mentioned earlier , so many fights happen through computer communications . Even if online conversations are friendly , they get people accustomed to making people "" @ CAPS3 "" through a computer , not face to face . After being in a computer - oriented friendship , people tend to forget how to act face to face and find personal meetings awkward . @ PERSON1 , an eighth grader at @ ORGANIZATION1 , @ CAPS4 , "" I can not @ CAPS5 only talking through computers , never being civilized with other human beings !

Firstly , computers hinder interpersonal connections . @ CAPS4 , @ ORGANIZATION1 help keep in touch with old college buddies ' , but no computer can replace face - to - face communication . From hard , cold text , one cannot decipher subtle connotations or wit . Bot , people are beginning to replace seeing one another with @ CAPS3 networking . With the technological revolution came games like @ ORGANIZATION2 . These games are addicting , @ CAPS4 , our society mocks "" nerds "" for spending too much time playing these trivial games , but it really is a serious issue . For example , in a recent study done by @ ORGANIZATION3 students , "" @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 teenagers who play computer games do not get the recommended amount of daily exercise . "" This is because these games are so absorbing . The amount of time put into gaming . Ultimately consumes all free time . This is dangerous , because a gaming addiction can lead to delusion , @ CAPS3 inadequency , obesity . @ CAPS2 a people , we are quickly learning that what was once so genius , is actually dangerous . If one was to stare at a backlit screen for hours on and , their eyesight would definitely start to deteriorate .

Our shool makes us do tons of project and the computer is our main course . If you want to go somewhere far away , you are most likely to research it , and then plan on going . It is also might be used to talk with friends on facebook , twitter , and @ CAPS3 . Computers help us learn and communicate . To start off , as an eight grades , we are prepared to go to high school . Fortunately , it means we do projects , reports , and research on the computer . The computer enables us to find information for a project , or construct a diagram or data table for a survey . Many people use this method for jobs .

They have a new thing now where you can play lifestyle games . @ CAPS3 is not as popular anymore and does not have as many cool things . It only let ' s you talk to friends and that is why no one uses it anymore . People want to be able to do more than just talk . It comes to my attention that computers have over time . Computers these days enable you to talk with friends , do research and projects , and let you book flights and buy cars . Our school ' s curriculum has many projects and reports . They can be done only by the help of a computer . You can research people and places and or get pictures . You can also book flights for far away trips and buy cars and other items off the internet .

These @ ORGANIZATION1 websites that gives @ CAPS3 the ability to talk with friends and play games have made @ CAPS3 lazy and addicted to the computer . My friend , when he was little , would play outside for hours and hours at a time . He would play all different kinds of sports with his neighbor .

Besides speed , computers also give you another great thing , communication . With emails , @ CAPS2 ' s , @ CAPS3 , @ CAPS4 , and blogs , knowing what your friends are doing later is just a click away ! This is much easier than calling the person .

Having friends so close by you can really make every life great . Out in @ LOCATION3 or @ LOCATION1 , solgiers rely on computers for valueable information ; such as radar , or robots .

Your practically just type in a word and automatically have hundreds or thousands of links , containing information on that word , to choose from !

9713,258,1,"Dear Local Newspaper , Spending too much time on the computer is never a good thing . Whether you are doing work or things for pleasure . I strongly believe this because being on the computer too long will mean that you are spending less time excersising , interacting with real family and friends rather than on the internet , and being on computer too long can ruin your vision . Nowadays with all the great advances in technology , peoples are always glued to computer screens . Lets face it , once you go on the computer , it can get pretty addicting with all of the fabulous things you can do and when we get addicted , we do not feel like doing other things like excersising . Studies show that @ PERCENT1 of the kids who use his or her computer for more than @ NUM1 hours a day is obese . The cause of this problem is obvious and it is kids being addicted to computers . Since they are so addicted to computers , the do not want to go to the gym or anything . Another example is that in school kids have a choice of what electives the want to take . Many kids would rather choose the computer programming class rather than physical education . This also cuts down on their excersise time . Computers are wonderful things , but when it starts affecting your health and physical fitness , they are enemies . Interacting with others on the computer can be looked at as a positive but it is not since it affects the way you interact in real life . For instance , some people develop a habit from only interacting through the computer that makes them anti - social in real life . Furthermore , some kids can be the most pleasant people to interact with through the computer but then when you used them in real life , they are the quietest people in the world . This happens because they are more comfortable interacting through the computer . Also , they have lost their abilities to interact in real life . Interacting through the computer is great if you have family and friends in other countries but you should not do it so much that you become uncomfortable to interact in real life . Your eyes are one of the most important parts of your body besides the vital parts . Most people do not know this but being on the computer too long puts strain on your eyes which is bad . This strain only lead to unpleasant things . For example , if you we addicted to computers , then there is a large chance you will get glasses someday in your life . A recent poll was taken and over @ PERCENT2 of people who use their computers for more than @ NUM2 hours a day have gotten glasses . Another example is that overtime the strain build up and up to the where even with glasses you can hardly see . Imagine a world where your vision is so bad that it is like your eyes are almost closed , that is what happens to people who use their computers too long .

In my opinion , computers hace a phenomenal affect on people and their lives . The computer helps develope hand - eye coordination , learn about specifil subjects and interact with people on the computer . Therefore , with such positive affects , @ CAPS3 should keep using this wonderful technology and get our jobs done . Have you ever walked into your schools lab or walked into a office building and all you could hear was the clicking of mouses or the buttons being pressed down on the keyboard ? we will , not only is a job being completed , but you are also exercising I remember last month when my class was assigned a five page essay . After the second page , my hands hurt very badly , @ CAPS4 , not only was i completing my essay , I was also exercising my hands . Not only does computers allow you to exercise , it also helps develops hand - eye coordination . Have you ever played a game where you had to cath fist , or playes a fast - pasle game of pinball ? we will , those games require one key thing i hand - eye coordination . Computers are very helpful in todays world . The computer and the world - wide - web is useful in several other ways too .

"" you have got mail "" I am sure you have all heard this before . Besides communicating through letters or on the telephone , the internet has also given us more ways for fast communication . when you need to confirm a meeting place or ask your classmate what problems were assigned homework , what could be a fast mean of communication ? Sending a instant message , or e - mail are two ways of course . Not only does computers allow you to communicate quickly but also privately . Both your e - mail account and you instant message account have passwords so that only you can access them .

I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one . A computer can be used for communication , education , and for accessing important information quickly , such as the local news . Now , let me tell you why computers are good for communication . When I was in elementary school , I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life . Unfortunately , he had to move away . But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while . A convenient way to do this was by using a computer . The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @ CAPS5 stay in touch . Different types of communication on the computer can be e - mail , instant - messaging , video chat , online chat groups . etc . This helps people stay connected . that is why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer . But , a computer can also be used for learning . At school or work , both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects , vacation spots , learning about animals , food , cultures , and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals . For example when my class researched different things about the @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 , our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers . We researched the customs , the foods , the way of dressing , the traditional holidays , and their way of entertainment . Also , kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it . This is teaching them hand - eye coordiantion , and how to type . The computer is not @ CAPS5 used for just communication . it is a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information . "" @ CAPS6 and adults often check their e - mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries , our country , the government , and the economy , "" says expert @ PERSON1 . I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what is going on in our town , state , country , and world . For example , it can tell us about the series of shootings goiong on throughout @ LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town . Us , @ CAPS7 citizens , wnt to know everything . for us to stay safe and notified on the latest . Another example is that I logged on the computer three dats ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @ LOCATION2 . But there are so many benefits of a computer . The effects computers have on people are beneficial . It allows people to stay in touch , learn about places and people , and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news .

Not all games have to be like "" @ CAPS2 of @ CAPS3 "" or "" @ CAPS2 of @ CAPS5 "" they can be games about sports . Supose one student broke his leg and he love playing soccer . He could just on the computer and play a game of soccer even though he has a broken leg . People can @ CAPS1 learn various facts right from their computers . The most important thing that computors are made for is to learn new things . No one in the @ CAPS2 knows everything , but if every one put what they know into the computer than people can get learne any thing from them , I remember @ CAPS6 my friend once told me about some guy named @ PERSON2 . I had no idea who he was so my friend started laughing at me , @ CAPS6 I got home I searched him up and by the time I was done reading about him I knew more than my friend about @ PERSON2 . If he ever have a question in class and our teacher can not answer it he / she always tells us to either "" @ CAPS7 "" it or "" @ CAPS8 "" it . They both are search engines . Not only can you learn a lot from computers you can @ CAPS1 communicate with people from different countries . What if @ PERSON1 did not invent the telephone ? How different would our life be me right now ? Anyway most people use the computer to communicate nowadays . Whether it @ CAPS9 or @ CAPS10 , or whether it is @ ORGANIZATION1 or @ CAPS11 all are a great way to communicate with people . With tele phones it costs money to talk with people in a different country , but with the roputer it is absolutely freen . You could be living in @ LOCATION1 and chatting with someone in @ LOCATION5 . You could live in @ LOCATION2 and email someone in @ LOCATION3 . Communication every where is fast and easy with the computer . My whole family lives in @ LOCATION6 and it costs us twice as much to make a call there . @ CAPS6 we use the computer it is even better because they can even see our fare throught the webcam . As you can see , computers are not negitive at all for all I know is that help people around the @ CAPS2 . They help kids have fun with the games we can play . @ CAPS1 , it teaches children and adults various now things . Lastly , it is a great communication strategy . I hope that you put those reasons in our local paper so every one can see how computers have a positive effect on people .",11.0,251,4.875682316805876,16.333333333333332,33,0.4648148148148148,5.0,1.5314814814814814,1.3456711978139104,0.053703703703703705,33.0
9761,1111,1,"Being a teen myself , my computer is something I do not think I would be able to live without . But is it holding me back from more important things ? I think so . I feel that not having computers will in a way educate people more so than now . For example with school research papers we imediatly go to the computers in order to find information when we could be using books and magazeens . With having the use of computers many people do not properly know how to use and find information in books . Also being around computers and using them so much is pulling families further apart and stopping humans from being more interactive with nature and the environment . For many people using a computer is a life style , it is something we tend to use more than religiously and that @ MONTH1 not be the best thing . Children , teens and even adults get extremly addicted to computers . Teens and children use laptops and @ CAPS1 ' s everyday in order to do their school work , and to talk with friends . As we will as parents / adults , they use it to get their work done and use it as a easy communication with co - workers . To this very day people have become very addicted to computers . I know for certain that in my family , my mother , nor my father , nor my brother , nor I could go through a day without using a computer . As I mentioned before computers are also pulling families further apart . There is less family time and comunication between family members these days , due to computers . Insead of spending time with the family , teens prefer spending time on the computer chatting with their friends . I bet if there was a poll was taken on how much family time has been taken away in households because of computers I almost garentee it would be quite a large amount . I know the only true family time some families have without computers is dinner and that is not much . Lastly many humans are not as connected to nature and as involved as they used to be . Using computer keeps people inside and not exposed to nature . Though there many advertisements and pop ups on the computer that inform us about how to take care of the earth properly , we so easily ignore them and remain playing on the computer than going outside and doing something to help make the world a better , clearer place . Not only is it just taking care of our earth , but it is also the fact that not many people these days go out and get the fresh air they need as much as they really should . Most likely not all of that is due to the use of computers , but I bet a great deal of it is . Like I said before it is super hard to imagine a day without a computer , I mean how would we communicate or do our work ? But there are trulthfully other ways to do them that we just are not very used to because of the fact that we are so attatched to them . I never really noticed till now that it is possible to live without a computer , and that so many people are missing increadable things such as family and nature because we are so addicted to the computers .",11.0,231,4.543649074947704,21.538461538461537,26,0.4117647058823529,6.0,1.568627450980392,1.0577422381270596,0.0124777183600713,26.0
9776,986,1,"Dear local newspaper , @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 students at @ ORGANIZATION1 say that they spend most of their time on the computer . I think computers have a bad effect on people because they can cause safety issues , health issues , and ofcourse education issues . With all this new technology , teenagers are not aware of their surroundings at all . On top of that , they are not aware of what is happening to them . Adults also do use the computer , but not as frequent as us teenagers . it is time now to realize what computers are doing to us and the world today . Computers can cause safety issues . Now more than ever people use where they talk to friends . But , what they do not know is that the person on the other side might not be what they think it is . Lately , on the news we hear of teenagers getting raped or kidnapped because of people who they were talking on the internet was not who they said they were . Bad people are always lurking on the internet , and we need to prevent them from getting in contact with the kids . But , even besides having bad people online , computers can with your privacy . it is possible for computers to give out your information to other people so , we really need to watch out . Computers though not only cause safety issues , but health issues also . Computers play a major part in destroying our health . About @ PERCENT1 of @ CAPS1 are overweight or obese . T . V ' s use to be the issue for people not excercising , but now computers are doing just the same . There are so many things to do on the computer that just does not make you bored . That there means that there is no way to from it . But , you need to get up and exercise and computers are preventing people from doing so . it is like it is hypnotizing us because we simply do not want to get up . Computers can also have an impact with your vision . I know that after a long time on the computer I have a massive headache because my eyes just hurt so bad . Also , computers can make people stop talking to each other verbally . Talking and interacting makes us have safe relationships with one another , but computers again are preventing this . Besides interfering with our computers do the same with education . Computers can really be bad with our education . Students now easily forget to do homework . There are so many distractions today that than of them whom people spend a long time on it , we forget to do other things that we ' re suppose to do simply becausewe ' re distracted . But , eventhough we forget our homework , we also @ MONTH1 forget to study before a test . This would result in a in high grades . Computers should not be distracting people , but instead helping them . I think it is not the people to not get distracted on the computer because it just has so many interesting features . For example , the internet , and websites like @ CAPS2 , @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 , etc . We have so many distractions in our that we do not need more ! Computers really do not have a good effect on people . More and more people get computers everyday . They should know what it is doing to them , and what is happening to the world around them go outside and enjoy nature ? Maybe , go to the mall with friends and . There are a variety of things to do rather than staying glued to the computer the whole day . People need to stop being and open their eyes to see the effect computers have on people .",11.0,239,5.242353109531647,14.452380952380953,42,0.3930921052631579,6.0,1.5723684210526316,1.6074253717321143,0.01644736842105263,42.0

These are the sites you use to access information from others to making plans for the weekend . Do you think that your children use the intrenet too much ? Nowadays , that is their way to communicate with their peer . It makes them more social , which is a great quality to have in life .

In a recent survey , @ NUM1 out @ MONEY1 @ NUM2 teenagers said that they use a search engine site , such as @ ORGANIZATION1 , @ CAPS6 , or @ ORGANIZATION3 at least once a day , @ CAPS7 out @ MONEY1 those @ NUM1 said that it is for school .

Friends and family are extremely important in peoples lives . Computers can help you keep in touch with them ! the @ NUM1 applications that I mostly use are @ ORGANIZATION1 , @ CAPS2 , and @ CAPS3 . @ ORGANIZATION1 is a free online application that you can download to your computer , add your friends , and video chat ! using this , I keep in touch with my @ CAPS4 , my friend who moved , and even a friend from @ LOCATION2 ! @ CAPS2 ( @ ORGANIZATION3 instant messeger ) is where you can send messages to friends and get instant replies !

I am friends with tons of family that I do not get to see very often , a friend who moved to @ LOCATION3 , and many other people that have moves ! @ CAPS3 , @ CAPS2 , and @ ORGANIZATION1 are great ways to keep in touch with other people ! When you are home sick from school and need to make up school work , instead of calling a friend from each of your classes , go to the school ' s webpage ! All teachers should have their own website that you can get from there . On their pages , they should have posted homework , quizzes / tests schedule , favorite links , projects , and their e - mail address . I find this very helpful because even if you do not understand you homework , you can e - mail you teacher ! Not only do school website have teachers pages , but they also have lunch menus , events coming up , the school address and phone number , and many more ! School could be a lot more difficult without a website . Do you ever have a question but nobody has the answer to it ? www .

Let me start by saying : "" I am a man who enjoys computers , as a way to talk to friends , listen and search music , watch videos on youtube , get school work done , and much more ! Although , on main point is it helps me stay orginized . I can make many folders to store my work in , rather then losing or spilling something on the paper if I wrote it out . I can have my music , homework , projects , does work , videos , pictures , and much more saved and orginized so I know where it is everytime I go to find it . There can be no more , "" my dog ate my homework "" excuse . Moving on to the next topic . As I mentioned you can save work onto your computer , you can add without earasing as we will , the work becomes neat and perfect everytime . So when you teacher is grading on neatness no worry . You can also look up information on any topic you are working on in class witch alows you to get . More information , the better the grade . Spelling is not a factor now , because your computer tells you when a word is spelt wrong . It even gives you suggestions on how to spell the word by underlining it with a red squigle line . This really helps because a lot of people have hard times with spelling . You can even get @ CAPS2 to play a book you are reading , witch helps you learn new words that you @ MONTH1 not have knew how to sound out . Teachers can even post notes on school websites of homework , when projects are @ CAPS1 , ext . No more , "" I did not know / remember what was homework / project due . Lastly , entertainment is the biggest thing with computers . People go on every day uploading videos , pictures , blogs , and just about what ever they want .

Personally I think not going on the computer benefits you , @ CAPS1 ' s more time for your family , going outside , and staying healthy !

9810,290,1,"Dear reader , @ CAPS1 , people have been debating whether or not computers are actually benefiting society , especially now that the majority of @ CAPS2 now own one of these helpful machines . Computers help people with everyday tasks and are no doubt doing more good than harm . Imagine how impossible it would be for most people to do their jobs without them life would become much harder for the people living on this planet . Think of the successful schools in our country , and then think of which of those schools do not have computers . Computers are the easiest way to look up information , something important when children are learning . Whenever someone needs to know something , they just google it . This comes in handy when researching for that huge project due next week . People have never been so knowledgable . Computers are only important for school , but also in the work place . They serve almost the same environments . Now that computers are so common , people can conveniently type up a paper and submit it to their boss or teacher . It saves time and effort with a more professional result . Computers also serve the important purpose of communication using email or instant messaging , one could communicate with someone on the other side of the world without that enormous phonebill . Some @ MONTH1 see this as dangerous because you could be chatting with a complete stranger . However , it is also opening your eyes to new cultures . Now it is possible to learn about life in @ LOCATION1 first hand . If computers were no more , it would be extremely hard for a regular person to interact with someone from another country . it is almost like isolation from the world . There are many out there who take great interest in learning other languages . Better ways exist than sitting in a classroom listening to someone talk . As a person on this planet , do you really want to be kept separate from others just because they do not live close enough ? A main concern about computers is that no one will want to read books and anything else . However , a recent study shows that after computers came out , more people have begun to read . This proves that just because there is now something fun and new , it does not mean everything else is trash . People will still continue to do things they always did , just with something new on their list . In addition , it is the option of everyone w / other or not they want to spent their time on the computer . If someone does not like the idea , they have no right to take it away from someone else computers were created to help the human race not control it . If a person does not want one , they do not have to get one , everything is up to them , and that is the way it should remain . The next time you see a computer , do not think of it as some sort of obsession that is keeping people from doing other thinkgs they could be . But as a universal device that allows them to broaden their horizons and learn things they probably would not go to the library to look for comuputers are not holding anyone back , but pushing everyone forward , whether at work , school , or even the house , they benefit everyone , everywhere .",11.0,270,4.749364189241178,18.366666666666667,30,0.4891304347826087,6.0,1.634057971014493,1.3609640474436813,0.010869565217391304,30.0
9820,1171,1,"@ ORGANIZATION1 , @ CAPS1 ? Are you there ? "" "" @ CAPS2 you hear me ? "" You never have that issue with computers . It has come to my understanding that there is a dispute about the benefits of computers - should we have them and advance them , or not ? we will , I believe that computers are a necesity to an average person . Computers help everyone , and make life easier ! Sure , there are cellphones and other helpful electronics , but @ CAPS2 they always prove trustworthy ? Computers are alwasy reliable - whether it is for homework or another reason ! Computers provide easy interaction without breakups , they make it easier to learn , and if you are smart then they are safe . Without computers , who knows where our society would be ? To begin , computers allow people to have conversations with others . that are halfway across the world ! There are a variety of applications that you @ CAPS2 choose from , and they are all easy to use . My personaly preffered option is @ ORGANIZATION2 email . I myself have family in @ LOCATION1 , which is a whole continent away ! Sure , I could call them , but my phone bill would be through the roof ! How else am I supposed to keep intact with my loved ones ? Do you know how many others face the same problem ? Through a recent study , @ NUM1 out of @ NUM2 families in @ LOCATION2 say they have relatives that are far away . That is @ PERCENT1 of @ LOCATION2 ' s population ! Imagine there was no computer for them to use . Phone companies would be in money and regular families would be living on the streets . Or worse - they would lose any relationship with their famly . Do you want that ? Computers are easy to access , and you @ CAPS2 interact with loved ones , friends , or new people . It does not get any better than that ! So , which would you choose - losing your family relations or keeping in touch via email and computer applications ? If that is not enough , computers make it easy to learn new things and accomplish tasks . I know that as a student of @ PERSON1 , other students and I need to type our homework at least three times a week ! Just yesterday I had to type up a response , a free writing choice , and an entry for a history project . Imagine if we had to go back to using typewriters . Either homework would not be done or everyone would have a major lack of sleep . Both options are unacceptable . Plus , computers are great for research . If you have to look up a new country , look at far away colleges or find out about the world , why not visit your handy computer ? You could learn which college is right for you without leaving your house . You could visit a new country without leaving town ! Sure , you could read a newspaper , but answer me this where does the paper come from ? Yup , trees are killed for them . Computers are the easy , environment friendly alternative for you . If those two reasons did not convince you , maybe this one will . Most people think computers are unsafe , and that @ MONTH1 be partly true . But if you are smart or listen in school like me , you will know that is not always the case . In our school , we are taught about the risks of computers , and how to prevent any possible @ CAPS3 . I am sure most schools do . In fact , nine out of ten students say that when it comes to safety , computers are rated an A + . Everyone knows about hackers , and so we avoid them . My parents even say that for over thirty years they have never had a single issue or risk of safety when using a computer , and neither have I . "" @ CAPS3 are only powerful if you let them be , and let them take control , "" says @ CAPS4 , an expert on the subject . So , if it is safety you are worried about , then do not . The kids of today , and tomorrow , know what is out there , and how to stop the minor @ CAPS3 . So , why do not we recap what we learned today . Are computers helpful and the best way to go for communication ? Yes , they are . What is the best way to learn now things easily ? I believe the correct answer is computers . What are safe even if some do not agree . It was not phones . no , not television . oh yes computers ! I see why you might think no , they should be outside , we will let me tell you , cellphones and t . v . will keep them from that anyway . At least computers do not rot your brain . we will , I have done my part . I support computers , and their advancement . But it is not up to me , is it ? No , it is not . So please do your part by spreading the word . it is the right thing to do . You know that you want to !

Whatever you do just get off your computer and go outside or the gym for exercise ! Secondly , computers interfere with family and friends . I know from personal experience that parents hate it when their kids will miss family dinner or will not go out with their friends because they "" need "" to finish the next level on their game or they "" need "" to look something up on the internet .

So next time you feel like spending another @ NUM4 hours on the computer , take a walk and I am sure you will be amazed at what you find outdoors . In conclusion , computers do not benefit society . They just keep people away from going outside , enjoying nature and spending time with family and friends .

People will spend less time exercising , less time outdoors enjoying nature , and less time interacting with family and friends . This is why computers have a drastic negative affect on people .

In addition , computers have given us amazing @ CAPS2 ways to entertain ourselves computers have a incredibly positive effetct on people . One reason why computers have such a positive effect on humans , is that we have developed many @ CAPS2 ways to communicate with people all over the world . First , one fantastic program such as @ CAPS5 ( instant messaging ) has given us the amazing ability to hold a conversation with one or more people any where in the world , and be able to respond within an instant . In a recent survey @ PERCENT1 of people said that they prefer instant messaging over any other type of communication beside face to face talking , second , most computers come with webcams built in now , so you can actually see the person you are communicating with . I had friend move recently , and we are able to see what each other are doing and remain friends even though we do not live in the same town , and I am sure a similar experience has occured to you or someone you know . Finally , the popular program of facebook has changed communication forever . People can now see things go on in your info whereever want . Although some it has a wonderful computers have established incredible ways of communication . A second reason computers positively import people is that they have created a numerous research .

If you can not get tickets to a concert you want going online to watch music videos by that person is a much cleaper alternative , second , jaming websites are a less expensive , but if you go online you can play similar games at no charge . Finally websites with appropriate funny stories posted on them are a fantastic way to get the laughter of a comic , without leaving your couch would not you prefer to stay home , rather than going out when it is not necessary ? computers are an incredible way to achieve quick , un expensive entertaiment in todays economy .

9905,37,1,"Dear @ ORGANIZATION1 , @ CAPS1 has been brought to my attention that some people feel that computers are bad for us . Some people say that they are a distraction to our physicaland mental health . Although I can see how some people would think this , I believe that computers are a good benifit to all society . I believe this because computers can help people learn , stay intach with friends or family that live faraway , and stay orginized . Sometimes people are on the computer , learning and they do not even know @ CAPS1 . Simply by visiting the @ ORGANIZATION2 homepage , you automaticly see the news feeds of things happening around the world . Other times people go online diliberatly to learn . If someone is thinking about going to @ LOCATION1 then they would probably go on the internet to learn about @ CAPS1 . Simply by searching equadore many choices will pop up you climate , sesonal weather , hotel options , and other farts . But that is not the only way people are learning on the internet . Now , many college students have the option of taking their lessons online . This is because some students like calm quietness or own house the distractions of sitting in class . Friends could be a big distraction in class , but how can you stay intouch with your friends if they moved away ? I remember in second grade my bestfriend , @ LOCATION2 , move away . I was so sad . I badey ever talked to her , but then one day our parents set us up on a vidio chat ! I felt like I was right their with her ! This was great , and I though about how many people could use this to talk to relatives or friends . Another great way to stay intouch into friends and family is through e - mail . By writing a message and sending @ CAPS1 can make staying in touch so easey , and your personal wants can chat and emails are a easey thing to send world wide . So many people love to type on a keyboard as we will , but so many different papers that you type could be lost . I , for me , hate clutter , and I have so many school binders for papers to be lost in . This is why I take great advantage of typing my paper every chance I get . My computer keeps me orginiced because I could never loose my work . File save , is an idiot proof way to keep all your files in a safe place . Then all you have to do is press print to get a hard copy . I am sure that many people love using their computer for the same reason . Also , I myself am a much faster typer than I am writer so my work is a lot needey on the computer . As you can see their are plenty of reasons why using a computer is goof for our society you can learn , stay intouch with friends and family , and stay orginiced .

These experts are judging computers too harshly , for it is not like everyone is zoning out in front of a glass screen , sucked into the world beyond . @ CAPS9 , most of these "" computer geeks "" are using the computer for useful things , while they are also used for entertainment , computers also help society to reconnect with long - lost friends or even get directions to a we will - know resuraunt .

9919,1201,1,"Dear editor , Computers are becoming more and more prevalent in the @ LOCATION1 . Peolple are spending too much time on computers instead of on other activities , an effect not beneficial to society . Because of computers , people have lacked exercise , missed enjoying nature and other parts of the world and forgotten about interacting with family and friends . Computers should be used in moderation and not in place of other important events in our lives . First of all , computer users receive significantly less exercise than those who do not use computers . According to a survey done by the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 only @ PERCENT1 of computer users reported that they exercised at least once every week . In contrast , @ PERCENT2 of non - computer users ( non - frequent computer users ) reported that they exrcised at least once every week . Can one imagine what it would be like if everyone was a loyal computer user ? Nearly everybody would be overweight , lethaigic from lack of sleep due to hours on the computer , and unworldly . Getting exercise is an essential part of everyone ' s life , and lacking it could be deleterious to one ' s health . Hopping off the computer and instead getting exercise , would make for a healthier and more fit country . Not only do computers deprive people of getting exercise , but they also prevent people from enjoying nature and other parts of the world . By traveling to @ CAPS1 and unfamiliar places in the world , one is able to experience and learn about other cultures . Going on the internet @ MONTH1 be a decent way to learn about other places , but actually feeling the ambiance and environment of a foreign place is allows for a much more profound understanding of another place . For example . when I went to @ LOCATION2 for a vacation , I learned about the differences in traditions and culture . I saw the separation between the poor and the rich when I lookes from humble sharks along the river to the portentous , eregant edifices scraping the sky . It was an experince I could not encounter on a computer . People should be able to enjoy the wonders and differences of the world not on a small screen of a computer , but through the screen of one ' s eyes . Lastly , computers inhibit people from interacting with family and friends . From my personal experiences , I tend to ignore friends and family . Speaking , playing , and generally socializing with others is a critical part of everyone ' s life . Without this basic necessity people cannot be happy . In summary , computers should not be used in excess . This sort of use could read to people getting less exercise , not fully experiencing the world , and closs of interaction with friends and family . To make a better country and nation , the people of the @ LOCATION1 @ LOCATION1 should make an effort to reduce computer use .",12.0,227,4.5767701355796255,17.923076923076927,26,0.4860813704496788,7.0,1.7473233404710922,1.141619525334138,0.0278372591006424,26.0
